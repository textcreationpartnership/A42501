            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And <hi>Saturne</hi> was couzened by his wives ſhifts, who kept ſome of his male children from his greedy tooth; yea and was made to devoure a <hi>ſtone</hi> inſtead of a <hi>man:</hi> does not this ſignifie, that a Planet may be prevented by that which is no Planet? <hi>Saturne</hi> vomited up again all that he did eate: ſhewing that nature repaires that by generation, which ſhe impaires by corruption. <hi>Saturne</hi> turn'd himſelfe into a <hi>horſe,</hi> to obtaine his love, or indeed his luſt: which ſhews what furious luſt they are prone to, that are borne under this cold and dull Planet. <hi>Saturne</hi> is old; becauſe of his ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and want of heat.

                  <hi>Rabbi Iſrael</hi> made certaine cakes, writ upon with certaine divine and angelicall names, and ſo conſecrated; which they that did eate with faith, hope, and charity, did preſently breake forth with a ſpirit of Prophecy.</p>

                  <hi>Rabbi Iohena</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iochabod</hi> did after that manner enlighten a certain rude Countreyman, called <hi>Eleazar,</hi> being altogether illiterate, that being compaſſed about with ſudden brightneſſe, did unexpectedly preach ſuch high myſteries of the law, to an aſſembly of wiſe men, that he did even aſtoniſh all that were neere him.</p>
               <p>A certain man called <hi>Heruiſcus</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> was endued with ſuch a divine nature, that at the very ſight of <hi>Images</hi> that had any deity in them, he was forthwith ſtirred up with a kind of divine phrenzy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sybil</hi> in <hi>Delphi</hi> was wont to receive God after two waies: either by ſubtill ſpirit, and fire, which did break forth ſomewhat out of the mouth of the cave, where ſhe ſitting in the entrance, upon a brazen three footed ſtoole, dedicated to a Diety; was divinely inſpired, and did utter prophecyings; or a great fire, flying out of the cave, did ſurround this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe, ſtirring her up, being filled with a Deity, to prophecy; which inſpiration alſo ſhe received, as ſhe ſat upon a conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeat, breaking forth preſently into predictions.</p>

               <p>It was a cuſtom amongſt the <hi>Antients,</hi> that they who ſhould receive <hi>Anſwers,</hi> certaine ſacred expiations, and ſacrifices being firſt celebrated, and divine worſhip ended; did religiouſly lie down even in a conſecrated chamber, or at leaſt in the skinnes of the ſacrifices.

               <p>There was once at <hi>Pharis,</hi> a City of <hi>Achaia,</hi> in the middle of the Market, a ſtatue of <hi>Mercury;</hi> where he that went to receive <hi>omen,</hi> did, Frankincenſe being fumed, and candles being ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which was ſet before it, and that Countrey Coyne being offered on the right hand of the ſtatue, whiſper into the right care of the ſtatue, whatſoever he would demand; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, his eares being ſtopped with both his hands, did make baſte away from the Market-place; which when he was paſt, did preſently, his eares being opened, obſerve the firſt voyce he did heare from any man, for a certaine Oracle given unto him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Philoſophers, being taken with deſire of Oracles, divine praiſes being celebrated, did waſh themſelves in a river, as in a bathe; and did put on white rayment, and linnen, &amp;c. — In like manner, the <hi>Brachmanni,</hi> the wiſe men of the <hi>Indians,</hi> were wont to waſh themſelves naked in a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, which is called <hi>Dirce</hi> in <hi>Boeotia,</hi> their heads being firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with amber drops, and odors fit for that purpoſe: then after they were according to cuſtome ſufficiently cleane, they were to goe forth about noon, cloathed in white linnen, with a white attire, having rings on their fingers, and ſtaves in their hands. In like manner among the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> it was a cuſtom to waſh themſelves thrice a day, and twice in the night, in cold water; before they entred into the holy place, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Brachmani</hi> did admit none to their Colledge, but thoſe that were abſtinent from wine, from fleſh, and vices: ſaying that none could underſtand God, but they that emulate him by a divine converſation, which alſo <hi>Phraortes</hi> (in <hi>Philoſtratus</hi>) taught the lower <hi>Indians.</hi>

               <p>THe <hi>Delphian</hi> Oracle was firſt invented by a Goat; and thats the reaſon why a Goat is there immolated by the conſulters.

The fame of this made it to be adjudged an earthly oracle, and ſo a Tripode was built over it for divination.

               <p>The Originall and foundation of Magicall and Aſtrologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call arts, is yet more dubious and fabulous, from the falſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and impoſſible, about the time of the worlds beginning, and computation of the yeeres thereof. <hi>Apuleius</hi> was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the world, and men, and arts therein, were from eternity.

The <hi>Indians</hi> boaſted of men living long before <hi>Adam;</hi> and that they could name who was <hi>Adams</hi> father and maſter. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> fained, that they had a ſtory in letters comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thirteen thouſand yeeres. The <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> dotingly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, that they had monuments of Aſtrology, containing foure hundred and ſeventy thouſand yeeres. <hi>Plato</hi> accounts many thouſands of ages to have been paſt, ſince the exiſtence of the world; and induces an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prieſt talking with <hi>Solon,</hi> and affirming, that <hi>Athens</hi> of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and <hi>Sais</hi> of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians,</hi> were built, one nine, the other eight thouſand yeeres before their time. The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> fained that the Starres, from their firſt originall, had four times runne their courſes, (and the Stars doe not once abſolve their courſe but in 36000 yeeres) and that the Sunne had twice ſet where it now riſes: and that their Kings, to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> had raigned there above ſeventy thouſand yeeres: and that for more then an hundred thouſand yeeres, <hi>Aegypt</hi> had been skilfull in comprehending the way of the Starres.

                  <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe being interrogated by a certain Souldier, why he laboured ſo hazzardous a thing as the fatation of a mans free will? anſwered, becauſe <hi>genethliacall Mars</hi> ſo ſtirred him up: or elſe thus, why he laboured under ſuch hazzard or perill himſelfe? becauſe fatiduall <hi>Mars</hi> had ſtirred up ſuch a thing againſt his fatiduall Oracle.

               <p>AMong the <hi>Seranes</hi> there is a law not to kill, nor to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, not to worſhip Images; whence in that region, there's no temple to be ſeen, no harlot, no adultreſſe, none is a thiefe, none a man-ſlayer; neither doth the ſiery ſtarre of <hi>Mars,</hi> conſtituted in the midſt of heaven, compell the wil of anyone of them to the murder of men: neither doth <hi>Venus,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to <hi>Mars,</hi> cauſe any one of them to ſolicite another mans wife: and yet every day <hi>Mars</hi> muſt needs come there into the midſt of heaven; and that in ſo great a Region that men are born there every houre, is not to be denied.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians,</hi> there are many thouſands of men, which they call <hi>Brachmans;</hi> they both by traditions, and laws of their Fathers, neither worſhip Images, nor eate any thing that is animate, they neither drink wine or beere, but farre from all malignity, are onely attending upon God: but yet all the other <hi>Indians</hi> in the ſame Region, are involved in adulteries, murder, drunkenneſſe, idolatry; yea, there are found ſome of them, dwelling in the ſame climate, which hunting men, and ſacrificing, devoure them. And yet not any of the <hi>Planets,</hi> which they call good and happy, could prohibite theſe from ſlaughter, and miſchiefe; neither could the malefick ſtarres impell the <hi>Brachmans</hi> to malefice, or malefacture.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Perſians</hi> there was a law, of marrying daughters, ſiſters, and mothers themſelves: neither did they celebrate theſe nefarious marriages in <hi>Perſia</hi> onely, but alſo in all other cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of the world whereſoever they came: whoſe wickedneſſe other Nations abominating, called them <hi>Magufiaeans;</hi> and there are in <hi>Aegypt, Phrygia,</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> very many of the <hi>Magufiaeans,</hi> that by ſucceſſion from their fathers, are ſtill pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with the ſame wickedneſſe. And yet we cannot ſay, that
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:46899:14"/>in the Nativities of them all, there was <hi>Venus</hi> in termes, and in the houſe of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and with <hi>Saturne, Mars</hi> aſpecting.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Getulians,</hi> this is the law or cuſtom: the women till the fields build houſes, and doe all ſuch like works; and moreover they may meet with whom they pleaſe: neither are they accuſed for it by their husbands, nor called therefore adultereſſes though they mingle indifferently with all, and eſpecially with ſtrangers. Alſo their women contemne all perſumes, neither weare they dyed garments; but goe bare footed. On the contrary, their men delight in veſtures, and odours, and various colours; yet doe they it not out of effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; for they are valiant and warlike above other Nations. Nevertheleſſe all the women that are born among them, had not <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> ill affected in <hi>Capricorne</hi> or <hi>Aquarius:</hi> nor were all the men born under <hi>Venus,</hi> conſtituted with <hi>Mars</hi> in <hi>Aries;</hi> which the fopperies of the <hi>Caldaeans</hi> can claim makes men both valiant and delicate at once.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> the women uſe gallant ornaments, and precious oyntments, and are more reverenced by their handmayds and ſervants, then their husbands are, and ride abroad in a ſingular pompe, their horſes adorned with trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings of gold and precious ſtones: neither doe they live chaſtly, but mingle with ſervants as well as ſtrangers: nor are they accuſed by their husbands, becauſe they Lord it over them. Notwithſtanding the nativity of every <hi>Bactrian</hi> woman had not <hi>

               <p>Amongſt the <hi>Arabians</hi> all adultereſſes are put to death, and thoſe puniſhed, that are onely but ſuſpected. In <hi>Parthia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> homicides are executed, ſometimes by the Judges, ſometimes by the kindred of him that was murdered: but he that ſhall kil a wife, a ſonne, or a daughter, or a brother, or ſiſter unmarried, is not ſo much as accuſed for it; for ſo is the law. Contrarily we ſee among the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> parricide is not expiated, but by the greater penalty. Among the <hi>Atrians</hi> or <hi>Adroams,</hi> he that ſtole the leaſt thing was ſtoned: but among the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> he that ſtole but petty things was onely ſpit upon: yet among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuch an one was beaten and wounded. From the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to the orientall Ocean,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:46899:14"/>he to whom murder or theft was objected, was not much ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved, or tormented: but if he had abuſed himſelfe with a maſculine, and that come to light, he was forced, through paine to kill himſelfe. And yet the <hi>wiſe men</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to purſue ſpecious boyes. In the ſame orientall coaſt, the parents and kindred, if they had known their ſonnes and kinsfolks ſubjecting themſelves to turpitude, they both killed them, and would not vouchſafe ſo much as to bury them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Gaules,</hi> the children marry publikly, and by the law are noted with no reproach for it; and yet truly it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that all they among the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who betray the flower of their youth; ſhould have <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and of <hi>Mars</hi> tearmes occident.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Britaines,</hi> many men have but one wife. Among the <hi>Parthians,</hi> many women (on the contrary) have but one husband; and yet they all live chaſtely, and obedient to lawes. The <hi>Amazons</hi> have no men; but, at ſpring time they goe into other Countries, and couple with their bordering neighbours: and thus, by a naturall law, they all bring forth about one time, and the males they ſlay, the females they cheriſh, and are all warlike women.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mercury</hi> in his houſe, with <hi>Venus,</hi> is ſaid by the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> to make man covetous, and money mongers, and deviſers, and paynters; but in the houſe of <hi>Venus,</hi> to make them unguentaries, or perfumers, and ſuch as exerciſe their voyces, as Stage players and actors of fables. And yet among the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> and in upper <hi>Lybia,</hi> and in nether <hi>Germany,</hi> and among the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> and the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and other Nations that inhabit the Northern parts of the Sea <hi>Pontus;</hi> in <hi>Alania</hi> alſo, and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania,</hi> and <hi>Othene,</hi> and <hi>Saunia,</hi> and <hi>Aurea;</hi> there is found no money hoorder, no paynter, no Architect, no Geometrician, no exerciſer of his voyce, no actor of fables: but ſuch a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> is found to be altogether ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and vaine, in ſo many and great parts of the world.</p>

               <p>Among all Nations men are born at all houres, and we ſee laws and manners prevaile every where from the power of a mans free will.

               <p>All the <hi>Iewes,</hi> by the <hi>Moſaicall</hi> law, doe circumciſe their children on the eight day; yet are they not compelled to it by the force of any Starre; nor are they impelled thereunto by the time of the region; nor are they induced to doe otherwiſe by the cuſtome or manners of any other Nation: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are, whether in <hi>Syria, Galatia, Italy, Greece, Parthia,</hi> they ſtill keep their Law; which could not at all be done by any neceſſity of their Nativity. For it is not poſſible that all the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould have the ſame Nativity. Futhermore, one of the ſeven daies, where ever they are, they ceaſe from all manner of work, nor goe a journey, nor uſe any fire, yet doth not any <hi>genethliacall</hi> reaſon reſtraine a <hi>Iew</hi> from building, or pulling down a houſe, from buying, or ſelling, on that day: but many of them are born, many are ſicke, and healed, and many die on that day.</p>
               <p>The ſect of the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which are found in every part of the world, and in every City; if the <hi>Parthians</hi> after they once become ſuch, they marry not many wives; neither doe the <hi>Medes</hi> (after that) caſt their dead unto the dogs, nor the <hi>Perſians</hi>

And in admiration of his magicall operations, they ſet up a ſtatue, with this Inſcription, <hi>To Simon the holy God:</hi> His Image was made after the figure of <hi>Iupiter;</hi> and the Image of <hi>Salena,</hi> or <hi>Helena,</hi> his harlot (whom he affirmed to be the firſt conception of his mind, the mother of all, by whom, in the beginning, he conceived in his mind, to make the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the Archangels) was made after the figure of <hi>Minerva:</hi> and theſe they worſhipped with Incenſe, victimes, offerings and ſacrifices. Howbeit this magicall ſorcerer ſimulated the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, and was baptized; ſuppoſing that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> healed by Magick, and not by the power of God; and ſuſpecting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> to be given, by a greater Magicall ſcience, he offered money for the gift: which being denied him, he ſtudied all

                  <hi>Saturninus</hi> or <hi>Saturnilus,</hi> and <hi>Baſilides,</hi> were notorious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors in all Magical arts, uſing Images, incantations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and all other ſuperfluous curioſities.

               <p>
                  <hi>Carpocrates</hi> and his <hi>ear-mark'd Diſciples,</hi> practiſed all manner of Magical arts; uſed Incantations, Philters, Paredrials, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacal aſſeſſours, oniropompiſts, or Dream-artiſts, and all other machinations, malignations, inductions, illectations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yea, they ſet up Schools of Magick, and taught praeſtigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous operation in publique; ſaying heretically, that by vertue of theſe they had gotten the Dominion over the Princes, and Fabricators of this world; and not onely over them, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all that are made therein. Teaching yet more heretically, that they who will attain to the perfection of their <hi>Myſtago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,</hi> muſt dare to do any thing; yea, muſt do any filthy thing: otherwiſe they cannot eſcape the Prince of this world, unleſſe by ſuch ſecret operation they pay their debt to all. And what was this operation of abſolving the debt in the body? but a nefarious coition of men and of women; and therewithal, an abhominable operating of incantations, venefices, and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatries upon every member of the body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Marcus</hi> (with his podalitial <hi>Marcoſites</hi>) was moſt skilful &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in almagical impoſtures; by which he ſeduced many men,

For faigning himſelf to give thanks over a cup of white wine, by his long invocations, and incantations, he turned it to red, or made it ſo appeare, that it might be thought, by that grace, from them that are above all, he diſtilled his own blood into the cup; through the invention thereof, and that they which were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent might deſire to taſt of that cup, that ſo there might diſtil upon them that grace which the Magician invoked; or which the Magician called Grace. Underſtand withal, that he had a Devil his <hi>Paredrial,</hi> or aſſeſſor; by which he himſelf did ſeem to propheſie: and ſo many women, as he thought worthy to be partakers of his grace, he made to propheſie, eſpecially he bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied himſelf about women that were noble, and rich, and gayly clad; and thus blaſphemouſly he would flatter, and allure them: I will that thou ſhouldeſt partake of my grace; becauſe the Father ſeeth every Angel of thine alwayes before his face; now the place of thy greatneſſe is in us, and it behoveth us to convene in one; receive firſt from me, and by me, grace; and be thou prepared as a Spouſe, to entertain her well-beloved; that thou maiſt be as I, and I as thou: place thou in thy cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the ſeed of light; take from me thy well beloved; and receive thou him, and be received of him; behold grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendeth upon thee; open thy mouth and propheſie. Thus ſhe being enticed, ſeduced, and puffed up, and her heart beating and burning within her, out of a hope, or preſumption to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie; ſhe dares to ſpeak any doting follies; and that (from the heat of the ſpirit) boldly, impudently, confidently vainly, empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And from thenceforth reputes her ſelf a propheteſſe; &amp; gives thanks to <hi>Marcus,</hi> who hath communicated his own Grace to her: and now labours to recompenſe and reward him, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with all her wealth and ſubſtance, but with her corporal co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, that in all things they may be one. A certain Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con in <hi>Aſia,</hi> who had received <hi>Marcus</hi> into his houſe, fell into
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:46899:17"/>this very kind of calamity; he having a very beautiful wiſe' this Magician corrupted her both in body, and minde, or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; ſo that ſhe followed after him a long time: at length, after the brethren had converted her with great pains; ſhe ſpent her whole time in confeſſion, bewayling and lamenting the corruption that ſhe had ſuffered by this heretical Magician, or magical Heretick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Priſcillianus</hi> was very ſtudious of <hi>Zoroaſter</hi> the Magician, and of a Magician made a Biſhop. He himſelf ſubjected <hi>Chriſt</hi> his actions, and paſſions, to the ſtars.

Nero</hi> being captivated with the effaſcinating allurements of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who had gotten his heart, by promiſing him (through his wicked arts) victory, dominion, health, long life, ſafety, &amp;c. all which he believed, that knew not how to prove the truth of things: ſo that he held the chiefe place in his friendſhip; for he took him to be the overſeer, and guardian of his life, and health. But after that <hi>Peter</hi> had detected his flagitious vanities; and had demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated how that he onely belyed the ſpecies and appearances of things; and that he effected no true ſolid thing at all: then was he had in ſcorn, and therefore conſumed himſelfe with griefe and envy. And although he had experience of <hi>Peters</hi> power in other parts (for under <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi> he was ſtricken with madneſſe, after that he was found to have dealt ſo mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly againſt the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> he wandred from Eaſt to Weſt) and comming to <hi>Rome</hi> firſt, he boaſted that he could raiſe the dead. It ſo fell out, that a Noble young man, a kinſman of <hi>Caeſars,</hi> died about that time, to the griefe of all. Moſt of them adviſed that an experiment ſhould be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could be raiſed again from the dead. Now <hi>Peter</hi> was accounted very famous for ſuch mighty works: but as yet the Gentiles had no faith, as touching any ſuch fact of his. Yet their griefe requiring remedy, to <hi>Peter</hi> they went: and ſome of them thought it meet that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſhould be called alſo. Both of them being preſent, <hi>Peter</hi> bad <hi>Simon</hi> begin firſt to raiſe the dead if he could: and if he could not, then he himſelfe would not be wanting to the raiſing of the dead by the help of <hi>Chriſt. Simon</hi> ſuppoſing that his art would avayle much in a
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:46899:18"/>City of the Gentiles, propoſed this condition: that if he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the dead, then <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be ſlaine, who injuricuſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked ſo great a power (for ſo he was called) but if <hi>Peter</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the fact, he ſhould in like manner be avenged of <hi>Simon. Peter</hi> is content and <hi>Simon</hi> begins: and drawing to the dead mans bed, ſo ſoon as he began to inchant, and murmurre his charms, the dead corps ſeemed to move the head, thereupon great was the cry of the Gentiles, that he was alive already, and ſpake with <hi>Simon:</hi> and a greater indignation againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> that he durſt offer to compare himſelfe to ſuch a power. The holy <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſiring ſilence, ſaid, if the dead be raiſed indeed, and live, let him riſe, walke, ſpeake: all this is but a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſme, and no reality: call but <hi>Simon</hi> away from the bed ſide, and then ſhall ye ſee not ſo much as the leaſt ſhew of it. Well, <hi>Simon</hi> was brought from the bed, and there remained not ſo much as a ſigne of any motion in the dead man. Then <hi>Peter</hi> intent on prayer a while within himſelfe, and ſtanding aloofe off from the corps, cryed with a loud voyce, Young man ariſe, <hi>the Lord Jeſus</hi> healeth thee: and ſtraight way he aroſe, and ſpake, and walked, and received meat, and he delivered him to his mother, who deſired him, that he would not depart from him: to whom he ſaid, he ſhall not be forſaken of him who hath made him to riſe again, whoſe ſervants we are: and thou mother, be ſecure of thy ſonne, and feare not, for he hath his keeper. Then the people ariſing up to ſtone <hi>Simon, Peter</hi> ſaid, let this ſuffice for his puniſhment now, that he underſtand his arts are nothing available; let him live yet, and ſee the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> increaſe even againſt his will. The Magician was much tormented in himſelfe at this glory of the <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> and collecting himſelfe, and ſummoning up all the force of his charmes, he gathers the people together, and complaines, that he had been greatly offended by the <hi>Galilaeans,</hi> and therefore would now leave the City, which he was wont ſo to defend. And appoints a day, on which he would goe flie, and ſo would aſcend into thoſe ſupernall ſeats; for the heavens was open to him when he pleaſed: upon the ſaid day he gets up the <hi>Capitoline</hi> Mount, and ſo caſting himſelf from the top of a Rock, began to flye. Thereat began the people to wonder and worſhip; many of them ſaying, it was the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:46899:19"/>power of God, and not of men, to flye with a body; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf did no ſuch thing. Whereupon, <hi>Peter</hi> praying <hi>Chriſt</hi> to magnifie his own power, by detecting the vanity of ſuch tempting arts, and ſo to undeceive the people: <hi>Simons</hi> wings were forthwith clipt, and he fell down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and died either in the place, or ſoon after.

Hearing this voyce, though he much reverenced <hi>Maruthas,</hi> yet was he minded to remove him, rather then runne ſo great a hazzard. But <hi>Maruthas</hi> (by his wiſdome and diligence) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the circulatory and praeſtigious fallacy: the King cauſed every tenth Magician to be beheaded. <hi>Maruthas</hi> after this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted <hi>Perſia:</hi> and yet returning thither again after a while, then began the Magicians to play their impoſturous prankes afreſh. For they cauſed a noyſome and poyſonous ſtinke in the place ſtill when the King and <hi>Maruthas</hi> met together: and this they foyſted upon the Chriſtians; and preſaged how peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous it was to the Kings health. But they being formerly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; were the more eaſily diſcovered, and puniſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. After the death of <hi>Iſdigerdes,</hi> his ſonne <hi>Baratanes</hi> was ſtirred up by the Magicians to bitter perſecution againſt the Chriſtians; <hi>Sapores</hi> alſo bitterly perſecuted the Chriſtians, and eſpecially <hi>Simeon</hi> the Biſhop and the Miniſters; becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to worſhip (the Planetarian god) the Sun, in which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the Magicians were the onely inſtigators and actors.</p>

                  <hi>MIleſian Apollo</hi> being conſulted about <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whether he was God, or man, gave this anſwer: That he was mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall according to fleſh, or body; wiſe in portentous, or monſtrous workes; but being apprehended by armes under <hi>Chaldean</hi> Judges, with nailes and clubs, he made a bitter end. Upon which <hi>Lactantius</hi> his comment is, That although the Oracle (as it was forced) began to ſpeak truth; yet it did it ſo ſubtilly, and perverſely, as with intent to deceive the conſulter, being altogether ignorant of the myſtery of God and man: and ſo ſeems to deny him to be God, by confeſſing him to be man. But in that it acknowledgeth him to be <hi>mortall,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, it is not inconſequent (although againſt the mind of the Oracle) but that he was immortall, and God never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, according to the Spirit. And why muſt he needs make mention of the fleſh; when as it was enough to ſay him <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall?</hi> but being preſſed with truth, he could not deny the thing to be, as it was: as he alſo was forced to confeſſe him to be <hi>wiſe.</hi> And what ſaies <hi>Apollo</hi> to himſelfe? If he be wiſe, then is his doctrine wiſdome, and no other: and they are therefore wiſe that follow it, and no other. Why then doe their vulgar account us vain and fooliſh: ſince we follow a maſter, and Teacher wiſe, by their Oraculous gods own confeſſion? In that he ſaith, that he did portentous works (by which he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the faith of a Godhead) he ſeems to aſſent unto us: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith him to doe thoſe very things, which (rightly underſtood and believed) we glory in. Nevertheleſſe he recollects himſelfe, and returnes to his daemonicall frauds of calumny and blaſphemy. For albeit he ſpake ſome truth, as neceſſitated, yet he ſeems to be a betrayer of himſelfe and the gods: in as much as he would have enviouſly concealed (through an inimicall and deceiving lie) that which the truth
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:46899:21"/>partly wrung from him. And therefore he ſaith him to have done wonderfull workes; but he meant it ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood not by a divine, but by a magicall or divining power. But whereas he ſaith further, that he was apprehended under <hi>Chaldaean</hi> Judges, &amp;c. I demand hereupon whether they were <hi>Chaldeans</hi> by nature, or by profeſſion? The firſt is not to be conceded as concerning <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilat;</hi> nor yet properly as touching <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas:</hi> and therefore (ſince he will needs call them <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) the latter is rather to be ſuppoſed: it is not ſtrange to be believed, that any one of them might be of the Chaldean profeſſion, or addicted to it. And why might not the Chaldaeanizing Oracle be drawn to confeſſe ſo much againſt it ſelfe? And might it not be one end of the <hi>Ecclipſe</hi> at his <hi>paſſion,</hi> to make even all the Chaldaeanizing Aſtrologers to confeſſe, with ſome of their fellows, that it was no other but the God of nature, that now ſuffered?</p>
               <p>One asking <hi>Apollo,</hi> what God he might appeaſe, whereby to recall his wife from Chriſtianity? The Oracle gave this anſwer (as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cites it from <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> a great enemy of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and Chriſtians) Sooner mayſt thou write in water, or fly in the ayre like a bird, then remove the opinion of thy impious wife; let her goe on as ſhe will, and ſing a dead God in vaine fallacies, and falſe lamentations: whom (the Judge rightly determining) an ill death hath ended. This <hi>Porphyrius</hi> cites, and expounds blaſphemouſly; as if <hi>Chriſt</hi> died deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from the juſt ſentence of his Judges. But St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conceives <hi>Apollo</hi> ſpake not thus; but his vaticinating Diviner: and yet not he, but this magicall calumniator; that durſt blaſpheme above the devill himſelfe. For <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe durſt not but ſpeak well of him, ſaying, he was ſuch a God, and King, as made the heavens, the earth, and Sea, and the deep things of Hell to tremble; of whom both he, and his fellow Daemons were afraid.

This man, of race a Chriſtian, then relapſed, is now returned a penitent: and being terrified with the power of the Lord, he is now againe received to the mercy of the Lord. Seduced he was by the enemy, and long continued a Mathematician; not onely ſeduced, but ſeducing; as wel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving as deceived. Many lies hath he ſpoken againſt God (who gave unto him a power to doe good, not to doe evill) ſaying, It is not a mans will, that makes him commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus;</hi> nor yet to commit murder, but <hi>Mars:</hi> neither doth God make a man juſt, but <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And many other were his ſacrilegious ſayings. How many Chriſtians hath he gulled of their money? How many have bought lying predictions of him at a deare rate? But now (as we believe of him) he abhors this lying trade. For having enticed others, he now perceives himſelf to be the moſt enſnared by the devil. And now penitent before God and men, he is become a true convert. For we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our ſelves, it onely proceeds from the awfull feare of his heart. Did we not rejoyce at that <hi>Mathematicians</hi> converſion, who converted from a pagan; although he ſeemed to doe it for ſome promotion in the Church? But this penitent ſeeks for mercy onely; and therefore is the rather to be commended both to your eyes and hearts. Receive him, and love him, leſt <hi>Satan</hi> again may tempt him. Let your teſtimony and approbation confirm his converſion. He was loſt, but now is found. Long did he knock at the doores of the Church, ere he was ſuffered to enter: but he is now brought in, and hath brought with him his bookes to be burnt (by which himſelfe might have burned unquenchably) that they caſt into the fire, himſelfe might enter into that everlaſting refreſhing. We ſuffered him the longer to ſupplicate for the remedy from the ſchoole of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe the art wherein he hath been exerciſed, is to be ſuſpected, not onely of falfity in it ſelfe, but of fallacy in good. And therefore we delayed him, that he might not delude and tempt us. But now we have admitted him, that he might not be tempted again, and deluded himſelfe. Pray ye therefore to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for him; for the prayer of his Church is available againſt all impoſtures and impieties.</p>

               <p>The parents of a certaine Virgin came to bleſſed <hi>Macarius,</hi> entreating him to pray to God, that her humane ſhape might be reſtored to their daughter, which they imagined to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Cow.

The <hi>Aegyptian</hi> likewiſe that had his wife made to appeare in his bed, as if ſhe had been a rugged mare, appealed to <hi>Macarius:</hi> and by his prayers, the praeſtigious impoſture was expelled.</p>
               <p>A young man dwelling in <hi>Gareoth,</hi> not farre from <hi>Aberdine,</hi> was haunted mightily with a ſpectrous apparition of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull woman, inticing him to lewdneſſe: which he diſcovered to the Biſhop, who adviſed him to depart the place, and betake himſelfe to faſting and prayer; and ſo he was delivered of the temptation.</p>
               <p>A young Gentlewoman of the Countrey of <hi>Mar,</hi> ſuſpected by her parents, and queſtioned ſomewhat ſeverely, confeſſed, that a young man kept her company by night, and ſometimes by day; but how he came in, or went out, ſhe could not tell.

               <p>IMmediately upon the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there was ſeen a <hi>comet</hi> hanging over the <hi>Temple</hi> in the ſimilitude of a fiery ſword; which did denounce fire and ſword to the City. Many nights together there ſhone a light about the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Altar,</hi> as if it had been day. The vulgar did interpret it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening the good and liberty of their Nation; but the more prudent thought the contrary. An Heifer alſo ready to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, brought forth a Lambe, in the middle of the Temple. Alſo the <hi>Brazen gate</hi> divers nights together, unlockt, or opened it ſelfe, and could very hardly be ſhut againe: and this the moſt thought to be a token of ſome future good; but the more diſcerning conceived otherwiſe of it. In the clouds were ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſeen a little before Sun-ſet whole troops of armed men. In the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Prieſts entring into the Temple at night to celebrate the accuſtomed Sacrifice, the firſt felt a mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then heard a ſound, and after that underſtood a voyce crying out, <hi>Depart we from hence.</hi> Four yeeres before, one <hi>Ieſus</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ananias</hi> a plaine Countreyman cried out in a propheticall ſpirit, while the City was yet in peace and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, A voyce from the Eaſt, a voyce from the Weſt, a voyce from the foure windes, a voyce upon <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and upon the Temple, a voyce upon the bridegroomes, and the brides, a voyce upon all the people. At which the Elders were moved, and cauſed him to be ſharply puniſhed; but he changed not his voyce, neither for feare, nor ſtripes, nor threats, nor perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fions; but at every ſtripe cried out, woe to <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> At length they weary with inflicting, gave him over for one mad, and that knew not what he ſaid. But he ſtill continued in the ſame ſad tune, till the very beginning of the ſiege, and then he ceaſed; as one that needed denounce no more, ſeeing the thing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:46899:32"/>denounced was now come to paſſe. Onely after the fire was already begun in the City, and the Temple, going about the wall, he began to cry again, Wo to the City, the people, and the Temple; and woe alſo to me: and ſo being ſmitten with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was ſling'd at him, he died.</p>

               <p>A certain Matron (longing to be pregnant) dreamt her belly was ſealed up: this preſages barrenneſſe, ſaid one divining expounder, becauſe nothing can come forth of that which is ſealed up.

A <hi>Sparrow</hi> is a bad omen to one that runs away: for ſhe flies from the Hawk, and makes haſte to the Owle, where ſhe is in great danger. To meet a Lyon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe is amongſt animals the ſtrongeſt, is good: but for a woman to meet a Lyoneſſe, is bad; becauſe ſhe hinders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; for a Lyoneſſe brings forth but once.

               <p>If a Snake meet thee, take heed of an ill tongued enemy: for this animal hath no power, but in his mouth. A Snake creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>Tiberius</hi> his palace, portended his fall. Two Snakes were found in the beed of <hi>Sempronius Gracchus;</hi> wherefore a ſoothſayer told him, if he would let the male go, or the female
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:46899:38"/>eſcape he, or his wife ſhould ſhortly dye: he preferring the life of his wife, killed the male, and let the female eſcape, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes he dyed. But <hi>Tully</hi> tels the ſtory otherwiſe, and reaſons better upon it. I marvel (ſaith he) if the emiſſion of the female Snake ſhould bring death to <hi>Tiberius Gracchus;</hi> &amp; the emiſſion of the male Snake were deadly to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> why he did diſmiſſe either of them. For the ſoothſayers anſwered nothing of any future accident, if neither were diſmiſt. And that <hi>Gracchus</hi> his death followed, the cauſe (I believe) was ſome diſeaſe, and not the Serpents diſmiſſion.</p>
               <p>Meeting of <hi>Monks</hi> is commonly accounted as an ill omen, and ſo much the rather if it be early in the morning: becauſe theſe kind of men live for the moſt part by the ſuddain death of men; as Vultures do by ſlauhgters.</p>

                  <hi>Darius</hi> dreamed that the Camp of the <hi>Macedons</hi> was on fire, and that he ſaw <hi>Alexander</hi> coming to him, in clothes of the ſame faſhion, as his own were, and that he was carryed on horſeback through <hi>Babylon,</hi> and ſo vaniſht out of fight. At this, the dream ſpellers were divided in their divinations; ſome interpreting it a fortune, ſome an infortune; ſome to the one ſide, ſome to the other.</p>
               <p>Betwixt the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> was a ſemblable prodigle (blood on the one part ſeen in iron; and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part in bread.) They of either party interpret it as a token of good ſucceſſe to themſelves. But <hi>Ariſtander</hi> (the moſt skilful of the Diviners) expounded it thus on the <hi>Macedonian</hi> behalf; if the blood had appeared outwardly, it had ſignifyed ill fortune to the <hi>Macedons,</hi> that were without: but for as much as it was within, it portended the like to them that were within the City, which they now beſieged. Again, a huge ſea-monſter appeared in the ſight of both parties; and they both made themſelves merry, in prognoſticating (according to their Magaſtromantick teachers) good luck to themſelves; but were both of them deceived in the truth, if not both in the event.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> having left off to conſult with his diviners; (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found them ſo various and uncertain) had yet again an itch to the ſuperſtition; and called his Aruſpicks, to inſpect the entrayls; commanding that the ſignification ſhould be be ſhewed to none but himſelf. <hi>Ariſtander</hi> is the man of art, and credit; but he notwithſtanding communicates the matter unto <hi>Erigius;</hi> who takes advantage thereby to diſſwade <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>

               <p>The ſame day that <hi>Alexander</hi> was born, the Temple of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was burnt.

But becauſe the hand of the Dyal ſheweth the courſe of the Sun, which never leaveth moving, they were afraid that <hi>Dions</hi> affairs ſhould have a ſuddain change of fortune.</p>
               <p>A certain Noble man of <hi>Sileſia</hi> was very inquiſitive with three ſeveral Aſtrologers, to know the manner of his own death.

Firſt the Feaver (forſooth) ſeized on him; then the frenzy thereof made him caſt himſelf out of a window, and that window was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Moate; and ſo he fell into the water, and there periſhed. The like tale do the Country people tell of our <hi>Merlin;</hi> the the King talking with <hi>Merlin</hi> about mens fates, cauſed a Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner of his to paſſe by diſguiſed, and demanded, what kind of death ſhould that man dye? <hi>Merlin</hi> anſwered, he ſhould be hanged.

And thus (they ſay) it happened: The King being on hawking, the Hawke took pearch on a tree hard by a River ſide: the Faulconer climing up to fetch down his Hawke, a grayne of a branch got hold of his neck, and there he hung; that breaking he fell upon a ſplinter, and it ſtabd him; that not holding, he fell into the River, and ſo was drowned. That the Magaſtromancers may thus contradict themſelves, and one another, is eaſily to be believed: but that their various prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions were thus compleated, let the faith thereof be with the Authors.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:46899:40"/>throughly conſidered the adventures, acts, and geſts of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> how long he lived, and how he died: all theſe being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, he did boldly judge, that <hi>Romulus</hi> was conceived in his mothers womb, in the firſt yeere of the ſecond <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 23 day of the mouneth, which the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> call <hi>Cbaeas;</hi> and now is called <hi>December,</hi> about three of the clock in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; in which houre there was a totall ecclipſe of the Sunne: and that he was born into the world the 21 of the moneth of <hi>Thoth,</hi> which is the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> about the riſing of the Sunne. Now is not this old way of calculating a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, quite contrary to the new? But of the twaine, which is the moſt certain? that a <hi>priori,</hi> or <hi>a poſteriori?</hi> ſc. from the acts and accidents of life, to the birth: or from the birth to the acts and accidents of life?

The chiefe articles that were objected againſt <hi>Socrates,</hi> were contempt and rejection of Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. <hi>Eudoxus Gnidius</hi> was wont to ſay, that the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> were by no means to be credited in their obſervations or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions upon the lives and fortunes of men, from the day and houre of their nativity.</p>
               <p>Two men, before their conteſt at the <hi>Olympick</hi> games drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the like dream, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were drawn by four ſwift courſers in a Chariot: they both conſulted one Prophet, and he prophecied to the one, that he ſhould winne; and to the other, that he ſhould loſe the prize.</p>
               <p>One told <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellius,</hi> that the circles which appeared in the waters like crownes, were abodes of Empire; another of them boded thereupon, that either they ſignified no ſuch thing, or elſe but the inſtability thereof.</p>
               <p>The fame is, that <hi>Iulian</hi> on a certaine time inſpecting the entrayles, there appeared in them the ſigne of the Croſſe invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with a crown. Some that partooke of the divination, were caſt into a feare hereat, that the Chriſtian Religion ſhould gather ſtrength, and that the doctrine of Chriſt ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall; taking it for a ſigne both of victory, and eternity. But the chiefe divining Artiſt among them, bad the Emperour be of good cheere; for the victimes portended proſperous things according to his own deſire: becauſe the marke of the Chriſtian religion was circumſcribed and coarcted; as a token that it ſhould have no large ſpreading in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulian</hi> again meditating warre againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> ſent to the Oracles at <hi>Delphos, Delos,</hi> and <hi>Dodona;</hi> and they all conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to incourage him, promiſing him undoubted ſucceſſe. But there was an old prophecy of former diviners, that utterly thwarted them all: for it foretold, that it ſhould be exitiall to the Emperour and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> whenſoever he paſſed with his army beyond the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and the City <hi>Cteſiphon.</hi> And thereabouts was <hi>Iulian</hi> ſlain, and his army overthrown.</p>

                  <hi>SErtorius</hi> a notable Captaine, was wont to faine viſions, dreams, and divinations; and pretended himſelfe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of many future events, by a <hi>white Hinde,</hi> that a skilfull friend had ſent him, to be his inſtructor in thoſe myſteries: and by theſe very devices, kept his Souldiers in order and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; and ſo atchieved many notable feates and victories.</p>
               <p>Two Countrey fellows came to <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> intreating his helpe in their cure, as the Oracle of <hi>Serapis</hi> had ſhewed unto them. One of them was blind, and he was told, that if <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> did but ſpit in his eyes, that ſhould reſtore his ſight. The other was lame of his thighs, and he was told he ſhould be cured, if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>eſpaſian</hi> did but touch the part affected with his heele. The good Emperour was ſomewhat ſcrupulous to make experiment of a thing ſo vaine and improbable; but at the importunity of his friends, and earneſt ſuite of the parties, he was drawn to doe as the Oracle or viſion had directed; and the effect preſently followed thereupon. Namely, upon their ſuperſtition, and the divels illuſion; for the <hi>Serapidane</hi> Divel was a raid, that his divining Oracle would fall to the ground, now that Chriſtianity began ſomewhat to appeare in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and therefore he ſent his patients to implore the help of <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> that by the rarity of the miracle he might hold up the majeſty of the Oracle.</p>

                  <hi>Alexanders</hi> ſouldiers being greatly terrified and diſheartned, becauſe of a bloody Ecclipſe of the Moon; hereupon he (ſecure of all events) called for the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> preſagers, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to expreſſe their skill. They concealed the cauſe of the Ecclipſe, and their own ſuſpicions from the common ſort; but forged this interpretation, That the Sunne was over the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and the Moon over the <hi>Perſians:</hi> and as often as ſhe was in an Ecclipſe, did portend the ſlaughter and ruin of that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:46899:41"/>Nation. The credulous ſouldiers hereupon conceived hope, went on, and proſpered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pheron</hi> an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> King, had a diſeaſe of a ſtrange cauſe, but of a ſtranger cure. He was ſtruck blind for caſting a dart into <hi>Nilus,</hi> and ſo continued for the ſpace of eleven yeeres; then conſulting the Oracle about his recovery, it was anſwered, he muſt waſh his eyes with the urine of a woman, that had never known other then her own husband. Firſt he made tryall of that of his own wife, but it would not doe: and of many others more, and at laſt he light of one whereby he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſight. And forthwith called all thoſe other women together, and burnt them; and married that one himſelfe, whoſe water was ſo ſoveraigne.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dictators, Emperours,</hi> and people of <hi>Rome,</hi> were taught by their augurizing and aruſpicall Diviners, certaine devotory odes, or formes of direfull execration, full of barbariſmes, and prophaneneſſe; that ſo the imprecating of the one added to the others vaticinating, might make the ominating much more forcible and effectuall.</p>

                  </q> Hereupon he added in jeaſting manner, that theſe verſes were very effectuall againſt a Feaver; if the ſeverall words were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed upon a piece of bread, and given to the ſick man in order, ſo as to eate every day a piece, with the word inſcribed. Now there hapned to heare him a good honeſt ſimple man, who not apprehending the jeaſt, believed all to be ſpoken ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.

                  <hi>Gotſchalcus,</hi> and <hi>Wierus</hi> relate this ſtory (one from his own knowledge, the other from anothers report; and though they vary in circumſtances, yet they agree in the effect.) A certaine woman grievouſly troubled with ſore eyes, light upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knaviſh Scholler, to whom ſhe complained of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, craved the help of his art, and promiſed liberally to reward him. He, either to make ſport, or in hope of gaine, promiſed to help her: and to that end, took a piece of paper, wherein he wrote ſuch kind of Characters as were never inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſeen before; and underneath them wrote theſe words in great Letters, <hi>The divel pull out thine eyes, and ſtop up their boles with dung.</hi> This he folds up, and wraps it in a piece of cloth, and ties it about her neck, and bids her have an eſpeciall care that it be not taken thence, nor yet opened, or read by any means. All this ſhe obſerves awfully, and her watery eyes were cured. About a yeere or two after, either ſhe let fall off through careleſneſſe, or elſe had a deſire to ſee what was there conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; the charm then being opened, and read, and the curſed contents thereof underſtood, and abhorred, it was caſt into the fire; which done, her ſore eyes returned in as grievous manner as before.</p>
               <p>I have read it in an Orthodox divine, that he knew a young Gentleman, who by chance ſpilling the ſalt of the Table; ſome that ſate with him ſaid merrily to him, that it was an ill omen, and wiſht him take heed to himſelfe that day: of which the young man was ſo ſuperſtitiouſly credulous, that it would not goe out of his mind; and going abroad that day, got a wound of which he died not long after.</p>

If any forbid, there's no more conſulting for that day: if it be permitted, then to anſwer the faith of the auſpicies, they goe on to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the voyces and flights of birds. It is alſo the property of that Nation to experience the preſages and monitions of horſes. They are nouriſhed publiquely in woods and groves; white they are, and touch no common work; onely put into a ſacred chariot they are accompanied by the Prieſt, and the Prince, and ſo they obſerve their neighing and ſweating. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there more faith had in any other auſpicie either by the common people, the Nobles, or the Prieſts. For they conceive theſe to be the Secretaries of the Gods, and themſelves their miniſters. There is another way of auſpicie, whereby they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the event of warre: they get a captive by any means of that Nation with which they warre, and commit him and one
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:46899:51"/>choſen out of their own common ſort, to try together in their own Country armes: and the victory of the one or the other they make to be a great preſage to either ſide.

               <p>Another time, an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> comming to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> feined himſelfe to be a Prophet, but was a Magician; he perſwaded the popular multitude to goe along with him to <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> and he would there ſhew them ſtrange things for their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: but <hi>Faelix</hi> followed upon them, and ſlew hundreds of them: onely the Aegyptian eſcaped, by vaniſhing out of ſight.</p>

But at night would ſecretly creep by a ſubterranean paſſage into <hi>Saturns</hi> hollow Image: and thence would he talke to the ſuperſtitiouſly deluded creature of thoſe things that might the more excite her reverence, and provoke his own concupiſcence. After that extinguiſhing the lights by his Art, then would he deſcend to the amazed ſoul, and mixe ſacrilegious adultery with his profane commentations. Thus had he long and often illuded a many of them. But it ſo fell out, that a Matron, more wiſe and chaſt then the reſt, abhorring the act, diſcerned <hi>Tyrannus</hi> by his voice; complained hereof to her husband: And the beaſtly fraud being detected, him they tormented, and the Temple and Image they demoliſhed.</p>

The Prince ſends his Page for ſome of it, and his other partner was hard by the door expoſing it to ſale, and lets him have a great deal of it for a matter of a ſhilling; and the impoſtor puts in this duſt among the reſt, and at length produces pretty ſtore of gold. The Marqueſſe wonderful glad of the effect, richly rewards the man, forbringing the art to that perfection; and ſo diſmiſſes him, minding to practice it by himſelf: which he doth with ſome happy ſucceſſe, as long as the <hi>Reſch</hi> laſted (which was a counterfeit powder mixt with the filings of gold) this being ſpent, he ſends to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries for more, and none of them could tell that ever they had ſeen or heard of ſuch a commodity.

Give him but ſuch a little ſumme of gold, and they ſhould quickly ſee how his Gold-begetting art would multiply it. The Merchants are content to venture ſo much for the experiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As all was working, he haſtily bids ſend of the Merchants men for two royals worth of the ſtone <hi>Onaſtros,</hi> to be had at any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhop; as he was going, he pretends there muſt be no delay, and therefore bids goe to the next Apothecary (with whom he had left a maſſie piece of gold, cruſted over, and coloured as if it had been a ſtone: and left order that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever came to aske for <hi>Onaſtros,</hi> they ſhould have that, and at a very low rate.

The Merchants ſend it to the Goldſmiths, and it really abides and anſwers the touch. At this there is exceeding rejoycing; and they are ſworn not to reveale his ſecret experiment to any. And now they offer to truſt him and his art with hundreds, nay and thouſands. To which he ſeemed more modeſt then at the firſt. But in an evening cals upon them for the largeſt ſummes they had offered to venture, pretending to begin the like expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment very early the next morning: which having got into his hands, he took horſe that night, and ſo rode away into <hi>France.</hi>

               <p>One <hi>Conſtantine</hi> a famous Alchymiſt told this ſtory of ſome of his fellows; that they greedy of Gold, blew long without either livelihood or hope of it; and then conſulted with a paredriall of theirs, the divell, to let them underſtand, if they were defective in any rite or ceremony requiſite to the Art, that they miſt ſo of their expected end. To this the Divell made no other anſwer but <hi>Labour, labour.</hi> Whereupon they fell to work a freſh, and plyed every thing hard, till all was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:46899:63"/>away: then came the divel thundering and ſcattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad all that was left, and made all their geare to fly a pieces, and laught at it when he had done.</p>

The fame of the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Fire devouring all where it came, coming to the eares of the Prieſt of <hi>Canopus</hi> (an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> god, in whoſe Temple was taught Magick by <hi>Aegyptian</hi> letters; and not unlike Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie too, or divining by the Stars, ſince they have a Star alſo of that name) this put him upon a crafty device to ſave the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of his god.

In come the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and as the two gods are put to the bickering, the Wax melts, and the water runs out, and ſo the Fire is quenched: and now is <hi>Canopus</hi> accounted for the victor. After this comes <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Chriſtian Prieſt to conteſt with him; and he (by the power and providence of God) makes the very creature Fire to conſume all, in deſpight of all magicall force or fraud: and ſo works the reformation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> not well knowing how to prohibit the Aſtrologers directly, did it ſubtilly. They exacted a yeerly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not onely of the Aſtrologers, but of all thoſe that conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Something they promiſed him, and he muttered a few words, and it came to paſſe accordingly. The man being askt after that, why he was ſo mad as to break his wares? anſwered, he thought he ſaw before him an ugly great Serpent ready to devoure him, which ſtill crept neerer to him the more he ſtruck at it, and when all his pots were broken in pieces then it vaniſhed. For this and other ridiculous pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous tricks, he was ſerved as <hi>Araon</hi> was, <hi>ſc.</hi> had his eyes put out; an apt puniſhment for all peepers, and Star-gazers.</p>
               <p>In vain was all the Pagan reformation of Magick and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. For they put the Artiſts or practitioner away with one hand, and pull'd them to them with another: witneſſe the edicts of <hi>Auguſtus, Tiberius, Nero, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>itellius, Domitian,</hi> &amp;c. and their own repealing acts, and eſpecially the <hi>Senate</hi> that baniſhed <hi>Martha</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> propheteſſe: and yet a little after retained and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Batabacus</hi> a predicting diviner. The <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> therefore ſaid wel and truly on both parts. This kind of men, treacherous to Potentates, and deluſive to all conſulters and confiders, are alwaies inhibited our City, and yet alwaies retained in it.</p>
               <p>I ſay no more of Imperiall edicts: nor of thoſe after the Emperours became Chriſtian; nor of provinciall Lawes, nor of municipall Statutes; nor of generall Councels, nor of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Canons; nor of Fathers ſentences, &amp;c. All theſe are ſufficiently collected againſt them. I onely conclude with an animadverſion to our own Countreymen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PLiny</hi> (writing of Magick) ſaith, that in his daies the Art thereof was highly honoured by the <hi>Britaines,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Nation ſo deeply devoted thereunto, and the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it performed with ſuch complements of all ceremonies, that a man would think, the <hi>Perſians</hi> had learned all their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick skill from them. And in truth our own hiſtories report, that the firſt Rulers of this Land, were Magicians, Aſtrologers, Diviners, (ſuch as were <hi>Samothes, Magus, Sarron, Druis, Bardus</hi>) and that under a colour to teach men the knowledge of the Stars: they brought men to the worſhip of the Stars. Yea, &amp; that
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:46899:70"/>they thus begat here their ſects of <hi>Samotheans Magicians,</hi> (In ſo much as the <hi>Perſians</hi> have been thought to have borrowed their word <hi>magi</hi> from hence.) <hi>Sarronides, Druides, Barditaes</hi> or <hi>Bardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi> and theſe kinds of ſects were propagated amongſt us, till the preaching of <hi>Fugatius,</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Lucius:</hi> and then they began thus to be aboliſhed, and put to flight. What? two Preachers put down ſo many ſects of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians? What a ſhame and miſery were it now, if one Society of Artiſts ſhould ſet up themſelves to pull down ſo many prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpel? <hi>Philip de Cominees,</hi> ſpeaking of fooliſh fantaſticall prophecies, ſaith, The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are never unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht of ſuch, from the cabaliſticall diſpoſing, and expounding of certain letters. What would he have ſaid, if he had ſeen his own <hi>Frenchman</hi> tranſlated amongſt us? Again, he ſaith, The <hi>Engliſh</hi> attribute much to prophecies and vaticinations: and alwaies are weak, when they treat of hard matters, to produce ſome ſuch kind of thing. Which, for all his reputed ſobriety, we cannot but take for a calumny. Who doe unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe (againſt all <hi>Merlinicall</hi> arrogators, prorogators, deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) that we are of the mind of <hi>William of Newborough;</hi> that ſharply inveighed againſt <hi>Geffray ap Arthur,</hi> for adventuring to divulge under the name of authentique prophecies, the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conjectures, and foredeemings of one <hi>Merline</hi> a Wizzard; and adding thereunto a great deale of his own. And doe herein approve of the <hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> for inhibiting the publication of <hi>Merlines</hi> books. Although we take them to be (as ſome of their own ſaid of them) like the Aſtrologers, who to ſave their <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> fram'd to their conceit, <hi>Eccentretes,</hi> and <hi>Epicydes,</hi> and a wonderfull engine of orbs, though no ſuch things were, &amp;c. We alſo doe commend the many wholſome Laws, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and municipall, among Chriſtians and Heathens, that have been juſtly enacted againſt them. And doe adviſe them not to make ſlight of the Eccleſiaſticall penances; however not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect true repentance. Otherwiſe we could wiſh that our owne Statute-laws were but duly executed upon the ſeverall kinds of them. And then ſhould we have the Magaſtromancers poſed and puzzel'd indeed, that is, not onely confuted, but confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHether the very word, tearm, or name of <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> be not of Paganiſh origination; and withall, of ſuperſtitious derivation and acception? As Fate or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, from praefation or fore-ſpeaking. And (I pray) whoſe ſpeaking? not Gods, but the ſtarres; nay not the ſtarres, but the conſtellated <hi>Oracles:</hi> For theſe were the firſt <hi>Faticanes,</hi> and their hills, or cells, the firſt <hi>Vaticanes</hi> that ere were heard of. Although I rejoyce not much in etimologizing, neither do account an argument from the <hi>Notation</hi> to be very ſtrong, eſpecially in names of humane impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet ſomething may (not amiſſe) be affirmed or denyed, from the notation of the name (though it be not ſo exquiſite, but allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive only) keeping the principall letters, and comming neer to the nature of the thing. Let them therefore give me leave a little to play upon the word: and if they will undertake to doe otherwiſe; let others judge if they be not more ridiculous. <hi>Fatum à fando; vates, quaſi fates, à fando, vel à</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; the moſt vain and fooliſh things of themſelves, that a man could either fear or confide in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether <hi>Fate</hi> or <hi>Fortune</hi> ought once to be named among Chriſtians? And how many eminent Saints of Gods Church have retracted, and repented that ever they have ſo done? And how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many of them have, and do daily warn men to be wary, how they rake the heatheniſh termes out of their aſhes, and tranſlate them into the Church of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> Not that they are litigious about termes, or ſcrupulous of titles: But becauſe the word of God hath not a word, nor a ſyllable, nor a ſound, nor a ſignification of either of them; if it be rightly tranſlated or underſtood. And becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them can be of any edification to the Church of God: but the uſe of them is a prophanation both of his Word and Church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether there be any ſuch thing as Fate in nature, or in the world? And whether they that determine for it, doe aptly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it: or in the determination abſtract and exempt it from the very hetheniſh originall and acceptation? And whether all their diſtinctions of Fate be able to diſcern it, for a ſolide and ſober truth, in any part or reſpect? The <hi>Theologicall</hi> ſate is abuſive; for that's not paganiſh fate, but divine providence. The <hi>Naturall</hi> fate is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; for that need be called no more but natures common order. The <hi>Stoicall</hi> fate is ſuperſtitious, for that binds all things, perſons, actors, (in heaven or earth) to an ineluctible neceſſitie. The <hi>Chaldaicall, Mathematicall,</hi> or <hi>Genathliacall</hi> fate is worſe than all the reſt, as adding to them all a ſydereall or conſtellatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:46899:71"/>fancy. But what kind of Fate call they that which they make to ſit in the middle, and as it were hover in the balance, betwixt the deſultory levity of an indifferent caſualty; and the preſultory temerity of an urging, and inevitable neceſſity?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether Fate or Fortune doe not mutually take away one another? For neceſſity and contingency have alwayes been held as contraries and inconſiſtents. Elſe to what end were all thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes betwixt the <hi>Stoicks</hi> and the <hi>Epicures?</hi> But why then doe ſo many Authors ſpeak of both theſe ſo promiſcuouſly? And why doe our <hi>Fataries,</hi> and Fortunaries ſo confound them: eſpecially in their prognoſtications, or predictions?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have been more ſerious than the <hi>Poets,</hi> about the <hi>ſeries</hi> of Fate? As for the <hi>Poets,</hi> what child ſmiles not to read the pretty fictious of the three <hi>Fates,</hi> or <hi>fatall Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; Clotho, Lacheſis,</hi> and <hi>Atropos;</hi> yea, or of <hi>Nona, Decima,</hi> and <hi>Morta;</hi> and of their names, derivations, progenie, order, and offices? As for the <hi>Philoſophers (Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Epicures,</hi>) It were long to tell, how featly they have toſt both Fate and Fertune, too and fro in their ſundry argumentations, aſſertions, definitions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But (better than all their earneſt) it is excellent ſport which they make (in their Mythologies, Apologues, Hieroglyphicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) with Fortunes <hi>wheel</hi> and <hi>horn</hi> on the one hand: and Fates <hi>Diſtaff</hi> and <hi>Spindle</hi> on the other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether argue the more ſtrongly; the <hi>Stoicks</hi> againſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, or the <hi>Epicures</hi> againſt Fate? Me thinks the <hi>Stoicks</hi> (for all their gravity) doe but rayl, when they call her the Goddeſs of fools, an empty name, a verſatile wind, a ſhort Sunſhine, a ſudden tempeſt, a muddy torrent, a fools paradiſe, a labyrinth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching her for blind, deaf, mad, brutiſh, inſtable, treacherous, envious cruell <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Querulouſly accuſing her for playing with her own gifts; and ſporting her ſelf with humane mortality and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: turning all things upſide down; corrupting her own nature, or ruſhing upon her very ſelf; repenting of her good, rejoycing at her evill; taking the ſtronger part; regarding not vertue, but power; anſwering thoſe more, that dare, than that implore her; carrying on things againſt reaſon, prudence, counſell, vertue; moſt deceiving, where ſhe is moſt truſted; fooling all ſhe foſters; ſmiling and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at once; tempering her hony with poyſon; immoderate both in good and evill; ſtrangling at laſt her own nurſelings; exalting
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:46899:72"/>and depreſſing; giviving and taking; dealing indiſcriminatly; ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the greedy, more than the needy; giving unto many too much, to none enough; now a mother, now a ſtepdame; when moſt flouriſhing or flattering, moſt feeble; and making but the more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy, for having been acquainted with her happineſs. But (in my mind) the <hi>Epicures</hi> (for all their levity) reaſon better. For though they might return the many invectives againſt <hi>Fortune</hi> upon <hi>Fate,</hi> yet they ſoberly argue thus; If there be neceſſitating and enforcing fatation upon things, muſt not ſuch a thing be done by a man, whether he be inſtructed or exhorted to it or no? nay, ſhall he not doe it whether he will himſelf or no? Is not the deſtinating decree enough to bring all things about, although there were neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, nor care to goe about it? Does it not robb all rationall creatures of mind, will, counſell, deliberation, to tye them up to inevitable neceſſitie? How then are their proper motions reſerved, not only to rationalls, but to every moving creature? What natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſeries of cauſes can there be betwixt intellectualls, rationalls, ſpiritualls, animals, in animates, and artificialls? Is it not ridiculous, to make an indiſſoluble ſeries, or conjunction of cauſes, where (beſides a deity) reaſon, and accident are ever and anon making an interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Who will ſay, that all things are concluded by, and included under Fate? Is there not much arbitrarineſs, whether one man will beget another, or no? and much more, whether one man will kill another, or no? How can there be ſo much as a naturall fate or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity over men, when we ſee they are not all carryed one way: as things of one nature or kind (beaſts, birds, fiſhes, flyes) are? but men (although of one nature) are carryed diverſly, as their wits and affections lead them. Were people have ſundry Lawes, and they duly executed; how are they led along by their conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent edicts, rather than by the fatall decree of the Starres? Are the lawes of men and fate repugnant? and are theſe more prevalent than they? If all things be neceſſarily bound under Fate; what can be ſubject to reaſon, will, nature, occaſion, time, manners, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, counſell, ſociety, contingency, caſualty? Muſt not mens ſins and vices be neceſſary alſo, and inforced? Why ſhould he be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for offending, that is not able to reſiſt an impelling force? Is he to be blamed, that is not of his own power? we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vertue, but what praiſe of the vertuous, not ſo by labour and induſtry, but by fate and neceſſity? Doe not the Authors of Fate
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:46899:72"/>goe, and come; ſpeak, and keep ſilence; offer, and forbear; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult, and deliberate; procure, and prevent; exhort and dehort, praiſe, and diſpraiſe; reward, and puniſh? and why ſhould they doe all this, if they did believe their own doctrine of Deſtiny? Why ſhould men ſtudy or labour, if their fate be ſufficient to make them both wiſe and rich? How many things are not as the Fates will but as we will our ſelves? Have the Fates determined that a man ſhall have children, that will not marry, nor once touch a woman? that he ſhall be wiſe, that will not learn? that he ſhall be liberall, that will not give? that he ſhall be drowned, that will not come neer the warer? that he ſhall dye in a ſtrange Country, that will not travell? If Fate have appointed a wound, or a diſeaſe to the body, is there not a medicine and meat to cure it? but if it could intend any evill upon the ſoul or mind, yet is there not education, and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to prevent it? Many things may be effected beſides nature: may they not much more then beſides Fate? If every man may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricate his own Fortune, why not alſo contrive his own Fate? If Fate had never had name, or nature, or power, would things have fallen out otherwiſe than they doe fall out? why then ſhould Fate be inculcated, ſince (without Fate) there is Nature and Fortune, to which all things (neceſſary or caſuall) may be aptly referred? In this old Philoſophicall diſpute, what eaſie Moderator would not give this cenſure? That either ſide hath ſaid ſufficient, to overthrow his Adverſaries opinion; but neither of them enough to eſtabliſh his own.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Hath not the conſtellatory Fatation introduced ſo many ſtarry Gods into the world? Yea, made ſo many providentiall, and <hi>tutelary</hi> Gods and Goddeſſes (ſome <hi>Select,</hi> others <hi>Aſcriptitious</hi>) to have a hand in the whole adminiſtration of the Univerſe? But particularly ſo many <hi>Geniall</hi> or <hi>Genitall</hi> Gods and Goddeſſes, and their ſundry ordinations and offices at every mans geniture.

               <p n="8">8. Whether Fate be one or many? If it be one ſimply, then what needs any reduction? if it be many, why is it not redueed to one? And then, in vain is that done by many, which may be done by one: and it is prophane, to aſcribe that to many, which ought to be aſcribed to one. If it be one truly, then is it undivided in it ſelf, and divided from all others: which how can that which is a <hi>ſeries,</hi> or connexion of ſo many things, be? eſpecially having its inherence in movables or mutables. If it be but one by accident, why ſhould it imply all under a neceſſity? If it be but one by aggregation, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, connexion, ſo are things fortuitous as well as fatall. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuch an unity is in the meaneſt degree of entity. Wherefore then ſhould it order, and ſubordinate things of a more perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than it ſelf? If it be many, or a multiplicity; then is it une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, indeterminate, uncertain, and next to a nullity. If it be one, why then do they make it ſo diverſe, according to divers conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conſtellations?

For among ſecond cauſes, and eſpecially in involuntary actions, and all ſuch as fall under humane counſell and deliberation; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall mind, and rationall will hath no ſuperiour.

And if it be ſo as Philoſophie ſayes, that they are the <hi>Intelligencies,</hi> that move the caeleſtiall orbes; then have they an ordination over the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Starres. The Devills are not only permitted, but wiſely and juſtly uſed in the execution of temptations, tryalls, judgements. (But how comes in Fate and Fortune? who can tell? unleſſe they intrude among the Devills, and be indeed of their foyſting in.) As for the heavenly bodyes, they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, as of Gods ordination and employment in their order, light, motions, and prodigious appearances.

Angels or Devills can but inject into the mind: they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, no nor yet incline the will. That's only for the infinite power of God himſelf to doo, men (as to naturall, civill, and morall acts) are ſtill actors in their own liberty. As for bodyes (Coeleſtiall

Ought not therefore ſuch a diſpoſition to be referred ſolely to him, that hath the ordination, and gubernation of all things (both in heaven and earth) ſimply, freely, eternally and immutably in himſelf?</p>
               <p n="21">21. How can the fatall ſeries of cauſes be from the ſtarres? when as the ſtarres themſelves are not cauſes, as in humane and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary actions.

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:46899:76"/>their inferiours. Now the ſtarres are both corporeall, and inanimate; Spirits, and ſouls; as they have more ſimilitude to, ſo they participate more vertue of divine providence than all other creatures: For they are both the cognoſcitive, and the operative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of providence, which the other are not. For theſe being but the executive only: may either be directed, or diverted by the iutellectuall, and ordinative. As acting of themſelves with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, deliberation, diſcretion obſervation of right rules, application of fit means, and intention to a due end.

               <p n="23">23. Whether any ſuch cut as fatation, may be properly ſayd to be in, or from the ſtarres? For fatation imports a primordiall law or decree; not an influence only, or effect: what ſacrilege is it then to aſcribe that to the inſtrument, which is only peculiar to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall agent? Since it is for inſtruments (eſpecially the inanimate) not to ordain, but execute only, (Yea, it is a queſtion, whether there be any fatation even in fate it ſelf?) it being accepted and diſcerned, not for a ſeminall diſpoſition, but for an ultimate execution: and that inherent in the moveable or mutable ſubject. Wherefore, ſeeing fatation is neither in the ſtarres, nor in fate it ſelf: whether can any thing be ſayd to be fatall with reſpect to the ſtarres? For the ſtarres are but ſecond cauſes. And with reſpect to all ſuch, ſome things may be ſayd to be naturall, ſome things arbitrary, ſome things indifferent, ſome things contingent, ſome things uncertain, ſome things caſuall: but few or none fatall.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Whether it be in the power and validity of the celeſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes to impoſe a fatall neceſſity, either upon humane actions, or yet upon naturall things? For if the ſtarres be any ſuch cauſes; then muſt they cauſe principally of themſelves, intentionally, directly, immutably. Now how can they be principall cauſes; when provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is above them? how of themſelves; when they work not upon humane actions but by accident? how intentionally; ſince they want a mind, or ſoul? how directly; when they operate upon humane actions but indirectly? how immutably, when their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or diſpoſition may be impedited? Again, were they thus acting; then ſhould there be no contingents, or accidents; no liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or free actions, nor prevention of any events or iſſues; no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cauſes ſhould be defective, nor diſtance of place, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:46899:76"/>of the mean; no neglect of the means, no endeavour to the contrary, or oppoſition ſhould be available: nay, not only the underſtanding, but the will ſhould be tyed to corporall organs and matter; yea, and the ſtarres ſhould not only be of ſufficient, but of infinite power.</p>
               <p n="25">25. How doe the celeſtiall bodyes work ſo fatally upon theſe inferiours: when as they here operate not upon a neceſſity, as to the producing of the effect. For albeit their impreſſions be naturall; yet are they not received, but according to the manner of the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which are fluxible, and not having themſelves ſtill after the ſame way. Becauſe of the matter, that is in a potentiality to many, yea, and to contrary formes. The matter alſo is movable, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptable, and may eaſily defect of it ſelf, may be intrinſecally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed, and extrinſecally impedited. And the ſtaries themſelves are but indefinite, and remote cauſes; to which the effect can never follow determinatly, and neceſſarily, unleſs the middle cauſes be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and then they follow them, and not the other. But in the foreſaid ſeries the middle cauſes are moſt of them contingent: and from many contingent cauſes can come no effect of neceſſity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any one of them, and all of them together, may be defective, and not attain unto their end.</p>
               <p n="26">26. Seeing the heavenly bodyes act not upon theſe inferiours, but by their light and motion; and ſo communicate nothing to the matter they work upon, but light, motion and heat: Now why may not all theſe flow from all the ſtarres in generall? And why then ſhould ſuch, and ſuch fatall inclinations, be attributed to ſuch, or ſuch poſitions or conjunctions? And if there be any particular vertues of the light and motion of ſome ſtars, contrary to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the light and motion of other flarres; how is that demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated? And how comes it to paſſe, that they ſhould be operative and effectuall one way, in their ſimple natures or qualities: and yet another way in their relative aſpects and poſitions? Is an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary relation, or reſpect of more validity, than a reall ſubſtance or propriety?</p>
               <p n="27">27. They ſeem to define fate more acurately, that make it to be the ſeries, or connext order of naturall cauſes. Now till they can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and ſucceſſively deduce thoſe naturall cauſes, down from the ſtarres, to thoſe fatall events: what reaſon is there to credit their propoſition, much leſſe their prognoſtication? They likewiſe will
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:46899:77"/>have fate (in the beſt ſenſe they can take it) to digeſt and diſtribute all things, according to certain motions, ſucceſſions, orders, forms, places, times. Now if their fate cannot be well underſtood, or diſcerned, without theſe ſame aſtrictions: why are they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounded at the inexplicableneſs of the circumſtances? Otherwiſe, why doe they not predict uſually the very times and places, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the fates themſelves? Moreover, the firſt definers of fate, held it to be, not in the ſuperiors, but in the inferiors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Namely, a diſpoſition inherent in the moveable thing: and that urging to an immoveable event. If indeed it be ſuch; ought not every mans fate to be collected from himſelf, rather than from his Stars?</p>
               <p n="28">28. How ſhould the things of fate, and fortune be foretold; when it is not yet (with one conſent) told what things they are themſelves? Some have gone ſo high, as to ſay that they are Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or Gods: others are fallen ſo low, as to make them vanities, and nothing. Some confound theſe two together: ſome ſet them ſo oppoſite, as that they make them confound one another. Some admit many things of both (as they ſay) at the fore-gate: and exclude all again at the back door. Some place them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, in the middle, in the end of a buſineſs. Some make us to be in their power: Some them in our power. Some would have us believe both but inquire neither. But if they would no inquiry after their nature, and properties: why make they ſuch inquiry into their operations, and effects?</p>
               <p n="29">29. Whether fate be mutable, or immutable? If mutable; how is it fate? Is there not then a contingency of fate: as well as a face of contingencies? If immutable; what hope? what colour? what means? what remedy? Nay, if immoveable; how moves it (as they ſay) according to the nature, and order of all moveable things? That is to ſay, with naturall things, naturally; with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtary, neceſſarily; with voluntary, voluntarily; with contingent, contingently; with violent, violently; with remiſs, remiſſely. And all this, not as a prime, and free; but as a ſecond, and neceſſary cauſe. Why may we not as well ſay, with rationall things, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally; with brute, brutiſhly; with ſenſuall, ſenſually; with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, vertuouſly; with vitious, vitiouſly; with proſperous, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly; with adverſe, adverſely; with uncertain uncertainly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then what irrefragable law of fate is that, which is fain to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:46899:77"/>to, and comply with every ones manners, and manner of working?</p>
               <p n="30">30. Whether fate be abſolute in decree, or conditionate? If ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute; then can it not be otherwiſe, and what remedy? Nay then is it infinite, omnipotent, eternall, and with ſuperiority? If con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate (and that not from a liberall diſpenſation of its own, but a naturall ordination from another) what fatation is that then, that comes upon condition? that depends upon others actions, not its own determination? If it be abſolute; then is it cruell, and unjuſt in many things: if it be conditionate; then is it variable and certain in nothing. Set aſide the firſt act, which is the eternall decree; and the laſt act, which is death: theſe indeed may be ſaid to be both abſolute, and conditionate; but Chriſtians are not taught to call theſe fate. But take it (as they doe) for the middle act; then can they make it to be neither abſolute, nor condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate.</p>
               <p n="31">31. Whether fate, and fatall events follow the body; or the mind? If the body; what difference betwixt the fate of a man, and of a beaſt? In events (good or evill) who is worthy? who is guilty? And how follow they the mind; ſeeing the ſtars (neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily and directly) make no impreſſion there? Becauſe it is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, according to the order of nature: and not ſubject to matter, time, or place: but united to an intellectuall, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſubſtance; and therefore cannot ſuffer from corporeall things, although celeſtiall. Nor can they ſo exceed their own ſphear, and ſpecies; as to act directly upon it. And if not upon the intellective faculty, which acts neceſſarily: much leſs upon the elective power, which is free; and never acts but freely; nor is ſubject to fatality, or fatall neceſſity. For then ſhould the election of the will be no more, but a meer naturall inſtinct; ſhould be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to one thing; ſhould act but one way; ſhould have the like motions in all, upon the like repreſentations; ſhould not have any thing in its own power, to diſcern, deliberate, chooſe, refuſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but muſt be carryed on, either naturally, or violently, as the Stars doe incline, or enforce?</p>
               <p n="32">32. Whether fate or fortune, be either in good, or evill acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If fate be in good actions; are they not neceſſitated, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced? if fortune be there; are they not fortuitous, and acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall? And ſo, what praiſe of them? what reward? The like may
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:46899:78"/>be affirmed of evill actions; and if likewiſe thus inferred; what ſhame? what puniſhment? In vitious actions, either fate offers violence to a mans will, or leaves to its own liberty. If the firſt, is not a mans will to be excuſed in evill? and if the laſt, is not every mans will the cauſe of his own fate? yea and of the hardeſt and heavieſt fates? For they are ſuch which follow ſin, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs.</p>
               <p n="33">33. Wherefore ſhould man (or his actions) be made the ſubject, yea the ſlave of ſate; when as indeed man, as man, is ſuperiour thereto? For fate being but a ſydercall ſervice of ſecond cauſes, muſt be reduced to the providence of the firſt cauſe: and in that reduction, man himſelf hath place, or preferment, before all the ſtars of heaven. Becauſe the divine providence receives to it ſelf, or extends it ſelf in a more ſpeciall way, to intellectuall, or rationall: that it doth to all other creatures elſe. In as much as they excell all others, both in the perfection of nature, and in the dignity of end. In the perfection of nature; Becauſe the rationall creature hath the dominion over his own actions, and operates voluntarily: whereas the other act not ſo much, as are acted. In the dignity of the end; becauſe the intellectuall creature only, by his operation, reaches to the ultimate end of the univerſe, <hi>ſc.</hi> to know, and love God. But the other creatures touch not that end, by an inſpired intention; but only according to ſome participated ſimilitude. Furthermore, God provides for the intellectuall nature principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were for ſelfs ſake: and but for all other crtatures ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, and in order to it. The rationall creature is Gods agent: the other are but his inſtrumens. Now God cares more for his agents than he doth for his inſtruments. Yea they are the inſtruments of this very agent: and he makes uſe of them either in his practice, or contemplation. God hath more regard to the free, and liberall: than to the neceſſitated, and ſervile acts of his creatures. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creatures are the more noble in themſelves, and of more neer acceſſion to the divine ſimilitude; and therefore tendred by God, before and above all others. They are the more principall parts of the whole univerſe: to which the leſs principall are but ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; as intended for their ſakes, and working for their ends. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall natures have more aſſinity with the whole; as appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all things elſe beſides themſelves: whereas every other creature is but a part, and capable of no more but a bare partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:46899:78"/>of its own particular entity. Now it is not for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehending part, to have an ordaining power over the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive whole. By the courſe of nature, the rationall creature uſes all other things for it ſelf, as either for the perfection of its intellect, the explication of its ſcience, the exerciſe of its vertue, or elſe the ſuſtentation of its body, to which the intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all nature is united. And therefore it is not for them, to diſpoſe, tule, govern, impell, neceſſitate him him: but for him to obſerve, rule, govern, diſpence moderate, and make uſe of them.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Whether any thing can be ſayd to be fatall (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us) till it have taken effect? For a fatality before it be, is but a contingency to us: and to us a contingency, after it is, is a fatality. Why then ſhould we be bound to believe the prognoſticated things of Fate or Fortune before hand? yea, though they may have ſome naturall cauſe, remotely neceſſary, or of ſome indefinite probability: yet is not all this ſufficient for our faith in particular; becauſe, as concerning many ſuch naturall cauſes, there is in us nevertheleſs (beſides the ſupreme) a liberty, and power to prevent.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Suppoſe the Fates have deſtinated one man to be hangd, or kill'd by another; why ſhould not that be prognoſticated from another mans nativity, as well as his own: ſeeing he alſo comes neceſſarily into the ſeries of ſecond cauſes? Indeed ſome of the old genethliacks have boaſted to foreſee, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell a mans fate, or fortune, from the nativity of his parents, Brethren, children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But have not others of them held it for a fooliſh fancy, that the fate or fortune of one man ſhould lye involved, not only in his own; but in the conſtellations of ſo many mens nativities?</p>
               <p n="36">36. Whether they that ſuffer the ſame fate, have the ſame ſtarres coupling, or compacting thereunto? <hi>Et è contra.</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them ſuffring (and ſuffring to death, the laſt line of Fate) for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Goſpell, religion, and conſcience. Is this fatall deſtiny alſo from the ſtarry order, and connexion? who ever heard that the ſtarres made Martyrs, or neceſſitated unto mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome? How then hath it come to paſſe, that young, old, men, women, of ſeverall ages, ſexes, nations (and therefore not of the ſame conſtellations) have all agreed to undergoe the ſame event?</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:46899:79"/>
               <p n="37">37. Whether that be true Fate, which they would mingle together with providence? and how can divine providence, and Pagan Fate agree? For Providence is the beginning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of all things: Fate is the end or utter confuſion of them. Providence is in the ordering of caſuals, as well as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: Fate is oppoſing all things fortuitous; and therefore not diſpoſing them. Providence is an act in God: their Fate is no more but an event upon the creature. Providence is a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion impendent, or out of the thing: Fate is a diſpoſition inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or in the thing. Providence comprehends all things (paſt. preſent, and to come) ſo does not Fate in her connexion of Cauſes. Providence is in and over all things, from the greateſt to the leaſt (good, evill, celeſtialls, terreſtrialls, ſpiritualls, corporealls, univerſalls, ſingulars, naturalls, rationalls, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries, neceſſaries, contingents) ſo is not Fate. Providence is more ſpeciall to one, than to another: but Fate is a neceſſity to all alike. Providence can work immediately, without, and againſt means: Fate can operate nothing but according to her ſeries, or connexion. Providence can act with every creature, reſerving to it its own motion (as with free agents freely; with contingents contingently, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) whereas Fate hath no way to work but fatally, that is neceſſarily, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly, inexorably, immutably, inevitably. The rules, order, ſucceſſe of divine providence, are either written in his own book, or in his own breaſt: and not in the Starres and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, as Fate is. The wiſedome, juſtice, power, goodneſſe of his providence; all this is written in his own book: the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſucceſſes, iſſues, events thereof, all theſe are written in his own breaſt. Even wiſe Providence it ſelf is not herein to be diſcerned or determined before-hand: what ſatuous thing is Fate then, that is ſo obvious and triviall, as for the <hi>Faticanes</hi> to foretell? Is not this difference enough between them, and never to be reconciled; Providence is a prudent counſellor, and will have the particular iſſues kept ſecret: Fate is a ſilly babbler, and will have them commonly foretold?</p>
               <p n="38">38. Whether (had it not been for the fictions of Fate and Fortune) there had ever been hatcht opinions and hereſies, ſo projudiciall to divine providence? and that even amongſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:46899:79"/>themſelves, that had experience ſufficient to convince them of the <hi>truth,</hi> and power of it: and of the juſtice, yea and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it in great part. Had the divine providence ever been denyed: if Fate and fortune had not been held for Gods? Had God himſelf been implanted under Fate, or made ſubject to the decrees of it, or ſlandered for a ſloathfull &amp; careleſs ſpectator of humane things, and terrene: if they had not confined and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted God to content himſelf with the reiglement of the heavens; as if it had veen beneath his dignitie and majeſtie, to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to look down to ſinall things, or once to take notice of of what was done here below: but to commit the care and rule of all ſublunary and inferiour things, to the ſtarres and celeſtiall bodyes; as his ſubſtitutes and their ſuperiours? Had prophane and wicked men ever accuſed providence, and excuſed their impieties: had they not heard of fatall ſtarres neceſſitating and inforcing both their wills and actions?</p>
               <p n="39">39. Was not the conſtitution of Fate and Fortune, firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in a derogation to God, and his divine providence: and that through a paganiſh and infidelious ſcandall at good things happening to bad men here; and evill things to good men, which had never been excogitated, or had ſoon vaniſhed, had they been thus Chriſtianly inſtructed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the all provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Creator diſpenſes theſe middle things with an indifferent hand, as unto creatures. That the beſt men upon earth, are not worthy of the leaſt of goods things: &amp; may deſerve to be invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the utmoſt of evill things, that can here befall them. That the wiſe Diſpoſer knows how to turn theſe outward good things to the evill, of evill men: and theſe outward evill things to the good of good men. That this preſent world is no time of full puniſhing, or rewarding: but theſe two preciſely pertain to the world that is to come.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Admit that either Fate or fortune was ſo indeed as they preſage; or much more than they can imagine: yet how is the beſt of them both ſufficient to moderate all fond hopes and fears? Or what is able to doe that; but a lively faith (voyd of theſe heatheniſh ſuperſtitions) and aſſuredly believing, That there is an all-provident God, that only foreſees all things neceſſarie: and to whom nothing is contingent or caſuall.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:46899:80"/>That can, will, and doth work (for the beſt of his) both with ſecond cauſes, and exteriour means; as alſo without them, yea and againſt them. That binds not the world, much leſſe tyes his Church unto them. That hath written his childrens names in the book of life: and much more then (they may be aſſured) hath numbred the hairs of their heads, as concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all earthly accidents. That ſhines, and moves in the Sun and Moon, and ſtarres: and makes their generall influxes more, or leſſe effectuall, as he is pleaſed to adde, or abſtract his ſpeciall motion; or oppoſe his immediate adminiſtration, or interpoſe the office of his more excellent Miniſters, Angells, and reaſonable Souls.</p>

The queſtion is not about the difference of all theſe (from the firſt, to the laſt) in matter, inſtruments ceremonies, or circumſtances; but whether they be not of like maleficall ſorcery, for main ſubſtance and formality? And whether divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Starres and Planets; be not a cauſe enclining and diſpoſing; at leaſt an occaſion inviting and encouraging (what through imitation, eſtimation toleration) to all theſe ſorts of ſorcerous divination, and the like?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether there be any kind of Magick ſimply ſo naturall, or laudably ſo arted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as many ſerve to abſtract it from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficall, and diabolicall? For though there be many occult qualities and miracles of nature, and actives and paſſives there, which perfectly known, and fitly applyed, might help to work wonders, without either tempting of God, or the Devill: yet becauſe of the difficulty of ſuch things; and not that alone, but their uſeleſsneſſe: and becauſe of mens ignorance, and for all that their curioſity; and becauſe of the Arts inſufficiencie, and beſides that, the fallacie; and chiefly becauſe of Satans pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie ſuggeſtions, and deluſory ſeducements; the ſtudy and ſearch after theſe things proves very confuſed, indiſcerned, unſafe and pernicious. And becauſe of all theſe the abuſe of this aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magicall art is as palpable as the practice: but the uſe as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as the Art it ſelf. But eſpecially as touching the practice of this art if there be an artifice of doing, wholly ſeparate from malefice; why then are the ſame things done by thoſe, that are altogether ignorant of the art; ſo they have but a ſaith? and why (without ſuch a faith) is nothing to be done by the Art it ſelf? How many things have been done by all manner of Magicians, that can have no naturall cauſes, no
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:46899:81"/>true rules of art, no power or comprobation from God? and therefore muſt needs be acted by a confederation and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with ſome evill ſpirit. How many things have they preſumed to predict or foretell; which neither divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is pleaſed to reveal; neither is it ordinarily for humane reaſon, or art to find out; but muſt only be done by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacall ſagacity, or ſuggeſtion? what ſounds, and ſyllables, and words, and ſentences doe they murmure, or pronounce; and that to the very inanimates; whom words can in no wiſe effect or move: or elſe are ſo barbarous and inſignificant, as that (if they were uttered to the intelligent) they cannot conceive them, their extent, or uſe. Now by whoſe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is it, that ſuch words ſhould be moſt operative in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick art; that are operative upon no underſtanding? How many rites, ſolemnities, ceremonies, preparations doe they uſe, which have naturally no force or vertue to the producing of the effect; not yet can any way prepare the matter to the receiving thereof? What ſacrifices, immolations, conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, proſtrations, adorations, invocations, execrations, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, atteſtations, comminations, exorciſms, adjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And none of all theſe commanded by God; and therefore not done to him: how eaſy is it then to ſuſpect, by whom all theſe are ſuggeſted, and for whom they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether if be (in Magick, and Aſtrologie) that the art hath power over the heavenly bodies: or the heavenly bodies power over the art? not the firſt becauſe for the Art to have power over the heavenly bodies (ſo as to ſtop, or turn the courſe of the ſtars; or by odes, and incantations to fetch down the moon from her orb. as the old Magicians have boaſted) this is beyond the power of a Devill, or an Angell: and were not only againſt the particular order of nature, but would utterly confound the whole courſe of it. And (by conjurations, or confections) ſo to prepare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to allure, or force down influences; and to make it (by art) capable, and ſufficient both to receive, and retain them:
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:46899:82"/>this were to mingle heaven, and earth; to ſubjugate the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour bodies, to their inferiors; to preferre accidents, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and turn the whole univerſe upſide down. Not the ſecond; for not only the ſpeculations; but alſo the practicks of their art (a many of them) are meerly intellectuall, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, arbitrary: over which the ſtars and planets can have no power. The ſtars are corporall things, arts or ſciences are mentall: how come theſe then to impreſs, and impoſe upon one another? All power is from action; all action is from forms; all forms are either naturall, or artificiall: now by what third kind of form doe the ſtars, and the Art, worke one upon another? And how agree their proper forms to act upon a third ſubject? How can the ſtars, or the Art (in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing forms and producing effects) work either naturally, by art; or artificially, by nature? Can a naturall form give principles of life, and motion, to an artificiall matter: or an artificiall, to a naturall matter? which way then will they have theſe two to conſpire, or conſent, either for the operating between themſelves; or upon a third?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Whether that power which Magicians, Necromancers, conjurers, inchanters inſultingly boaſt of, againſt Devils, and evill ſpirits, by way of coaction and compulſion: be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed by way of invocation, and ſubjection? For though <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſubdued Devils; and ejected them by a divine, and extraordinary power: but as for meer men, and the vileſt of men, ſince God hath denyed them the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar gift; who hath taught them the triviall art of acting over, or commanding evill ſpirits? Or have they taken it upon themſelves (as did the <hi>Jewiſh Exorciſts Acts</hi> 19.3.) and is not indeed all their power and authority of the ſame force, as was theirs? But inſtead of preaching to ſuch, let me firſt reaſon with them. Is it credible, that a mortall man ſhould be able to bind an immortall Spirit? and bind him by a word, a ſound a ſyllable, a character? and theſe inſignificant, and no vertue of Gods promiſe in them? Can theſe men doe that to the Devill, which he cannot doe to them: compell him to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:46899:82"/>doe good, or evill? If they can compell him to doe the thing that good is; then are they able to doe as much as God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf doth: and to compell him to doe evill, that they need not, he is alwaies as ready to doe that, as they. Devils are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the order, and power of ſenſible things: how then ſhould they be ſufficient to move them, either by way of allurement, or conſtraint? If the Devill doe at any time work with man, he will not doe it <hi>gratis,</hi> or freely; unleſs it be upon his own errands, and to his own ends; for he hates mankind, and their indifferent commerce. And therefore ſince he will not doe it voluntarily, and cannot be compelled; if he acts at all, it muſt either be upon a temptation of his own, or elſe upon a confederation of theirs. And if he be enjoyned to obey by covenant or compact, then is not the malefice as much as confeſt? Reaſon and experience prove, that the Devil can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forced to ſtand to his own promiſes: how much leſs then to any mans precept, or command? And therefore if the Devill appear at the provocation, recede at the commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, anſwer at the call, and obey at the command of a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancer; what diſſimulation of obedience is there on both ſides? One ſecretly imploring, and outwardly injoyning: the other outwardly obſerving, but inwardly inſlaving. For it is not they that bind the Devill; but the Devill that binds them to obedience. Only he ſeems to be enforced to doe theirs; that ſo he may make them willing to do his will. Or that his feigned conſtraint might either the more excuſe him; or elſe ſet them the more without excuſe both before God, and men; what command or inforcement is that, which is done not only to others injury but oft-times to the actors own hurt? eſpecially if he be doubting, and have not a ſtrong faith, and obſerve not all the circumſtances of adjuring; which ſhews all the force (on one part, or other) to be only in a pactionall arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. The main thing that the Aſtrologicall Magicians, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cromancers, conjurers, and inchanters pretend, is, that they can ſtand without his chain, and yet bring him (will he, nill he) within their circle: and all by vertue of the celeſtiall orbes; only calling, and urging him under certain aſpects,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:46899:83"/>conjunctions, conſtellations. But alas! theſe cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or impoſe upon him (neither of themſelves, nor by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; neither directly, nor indirectly) he being a meer ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall ſubſtance, and formally united to no body. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he be obſervant upon ſuch tearms, it is to indulge a ſuperſtitious faith, and perſwaſion of the vertue of ſuch things, and efficacy of ſuch an art, beſides, above, againſt the word of God. And he obeys now, not as neceſſitated thereby, as by cauſes; but yeelding thereto, as unto Signs. Signs indeed of a compact, or confederation.

It cannot be God; becauſe they have no command to imitate him, in theſe his powerfull

Or that the one operates by the celeſtial, the other by terreſtrial imps? Hath not idolatry, and ſuperſtition, (and why not witchcraft?) been committed by things in Heaven, as well as things on earth? Me thinks a Magician operates by the baſer imp of the two. For a Witch works by a living dog, cat, mouſe, rat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he by a dead one, configured, conſtellated, written, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ingraven.

Another will have them to depend upon the powers of the ſoule, the influxes of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, together with certain images, or reſemblances, whether of fantaſie or configuration. Others will have them wholly cauſed by their conſtellations And if they would bring in the Devil among the reſt (as ſome of them have confeſt he is not to be kept out) they ſhould finde him to be the greateſt cauſe of all: eſpecially of the vain obſervation of them, and ſuperſtitious omination upon them. Who will deny, that there may be ſome obſervation of ſome dreams, and ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation made upon them, as touching either the health, or ſickneſſe of the body, the vertuous or vitious inclinations and affections of the minde; yea, and (though rarely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily) for the caution, and encouragement, as touching ſome ſpecial actions and events? But I demand, of Magical and Aſtrological men: not ſo much whether there be one common rule to all, for the interpretation of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:46899:89"/>dreams, As whether this (taught by themſelves) be either a ſecond cauſe of dreams, or a ſafe rule to interpret them? <hi>viz. That dreams are more efficacious, when the Moon over-runs that ſigne, which was in the ninth number of the Nativity, or revolution of that yeer; or in the ninth ſigne, from the ſigne of perfection. For it is a moſt true and certain divination; neither doth it proceed from nature, or humane arts, but from purified minds, by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> They ſhall do well, not onely (by true reaſon) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve us fully, of the truth they ſpeak: but alſo (in good ſenſe) of the terms, they ſpeak withal.</p>

Whether the vain obſervations, and ſuperſtitious, nay ridiculous ominations of <hi>Phyſiognomie,</hi> had ever been ſo vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly taken up, but by reaſon of Magick, and Aſtrologie?

Do they not gather the Phyſiognomie of Elements, from ſtars, and ſtarry influences or diſpoſitions? And the phyſiognomy of Minerals, Gemmes, and Stones; from ſtarry ſignatures, and figures?

Oh! Is not this a rare and profound art (fit for none but Gipſies and Juglers to profeſſe) that teaches to judge of

               <p n="4">4. As <hi>Metopoſcopie,</hi> or the inſpecting of the front, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head; (together with other parts of Phyſiognomie) boaſts it ſelf for the Scholler: ſo whether <hi>Chiremancy,</hi> or <hi>Palmeſtry;</hi> (the inſpecting of the hand, or palme) may not be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a miſtreſſe, in obſervating, and ominating Magick, and Aſtrologie? Why diſtinguiſh they betwixt Chiromancy Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, and Aſtrological? As it phyſical conjectures were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; there muſt alſo be Aſtrological divination. And to this purpoſe; what fictitious appellations of <hi>Minuts</hi> and <hi>Lines</hi> to be reckoned according to the number; and explained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the Planets? What a Chyroſcopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal horoſcope, or a Planetarian Manual, of jugling, legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and ſuperſtitious impoſture? From the Magical cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the heavens, in the hand; what Aſtrological prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtications, or ominations; not of corporal motions, and temper; and not onely of civil actions, and events; but even of ſpiritual affections, and manners? Is it by the help of art, that they here probably conjecture? Nay, is it not by diabolical inſtinct, that they here peremptorily vaticinate, or ominate of long life, ſhort life, marriage, ſingle life, fortuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, infortunity, vertue, and vice? Yet for all that, what's here that is not as vainly obſerved, and as ridiculouſly ominated and portended; as in any other part of Phyſiognomie? As a great thick hand ſignes one not onely ſtrong, but ſtout; a little ſlender hand, one not onely weak, but timerous; a long hand, and long fingers, betoken a man not onely apt for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical artifice, but liberally ingenious; but thoſe ſhort on the contrary, note a foole, and fit for not hing: an hard braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hand ſignes dull, and rude; a ſoft hand witty, but effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: an hairy hand, luxurious; long joynts, ſigne generous; yet if they be thick withal, not ſo ingenious; the often clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and folding of the hands, note covetous; and their much moving in ſpeech, loquacious; an <hi>ambidexter</hi> is noted for ireful, crafty, injurious; ſhort and fat fingers, mark a man out for intemperate and ſilly; but long and leane, for witty; if his fingers crook upward, that ſhewes him liberal; if down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:46899:92"/>niggardly; the lines ſpreading at the bottom joynt of the thumb, ſigne contentious, the line above the middle of the thumbe, if it meet round about, portends a hanging deſtiny: many lines tranſverſe upon the laſt joynt of the forefinger, note riches by heirdome: and right lines there, are a note of a jovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al nature: lines in the points of the middle finger (like a grid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iron) note a melancholly wit, and unhappy: if the ſigne on the little finger be conſpicuous, they note a good wit, and eloquent, but the contrary, if obſcure: equal lines upon the firſt joynt of the ring finger, are marks of an happy wit; long nayles and crooked, ſigne one brutiſh, ravenous, unchaſte: very ſhort nails, pale, and ſharp, ſhew him falſe, ſubtile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiling: and ſo round nails, libidinous: but nails broad, plain, thin, white, and reddiſh, are the tokens of a very good wit.

               <p n="5">5. Which way go the Phyſiognomiſts, Metopoſcopiſts, and Chiromantiſts to work (for all this obſervation, and omina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs) but either (as they pretend) from the cauſe, to the effect. And how is that? but firſt judging and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the man, or the member, to be <hi>Saturnine, Jovial, Martial, Solar, Venereal, Mercurial, Lunar.</hi> Or elſe, from the effect, to the cauſe (as they ſay) by collecting their horoſcope from the habitude of the body? And thus what do they? but trifle, and delude which way they pleaſe, by inſpections, obſervations, ominations, predictions of manners, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, to the great diſhonour of God, and reproach of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; were it not that their art is proved to be an abſurd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture, both by reaſon, experience, vertue, and Grace. For what can they ſay? but that paſſions, and affections may break forth, and ſhew themſelves in the alterations of ſome outward parts. What then? Becauſe they may do ſo in ſome parts: will they therefore make all to be ſignifying, and ſigning? Nay, and even in thoſe parts, where thoſe eruptions, or ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications are, it is but upon a preſent provocation: will they then make ſuch collections, and preſagitions by them, as if they were habitually ſeated there? But I am weary of theſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:46899:92"/>Artiſts, I will therefore only turn them over to their own fautors, who tell them plainly, that it is not neceſſary, nor of any rational conſecution, that the condition, manners, and ſtudies, and inſtitutes of mans nature (together with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſions, and agitations of his minde) ſhould be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to external marks: neither yet to be meaſured by any ſignal lineaments of his body. Becauſe a man may conceive, and agitate many things inwardly in his minde: whereof there is not the leaſt ſhew or appearance outwardly in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And becauſe a man may be of an enormous body, and diſtorted members: and nevertheleſſe poſſeſſe a minde excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in all good culture: and on the contrary, be of a decent and compleat frame or ſhape, and yet of manners ugly and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favoured enough. And that there is not the leaſt reaſon, nor any rule of truth for theſe their conjectures, obſervations, and ominations: neither are they agreed among themſelves, about their own abſurd figments. And therefore it is to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that theſe nugacious kinds of men do onely dote through the inſtinct of the devil, drawing them from errour into ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and from that into infidelity.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether <hi>Augurizing, auſpicating,</hi> and <hi>aruſpicinating</hi> (and all ſuch heatheniſh obſervations, and ominations) were not founded upon Magick and Aſtrologie? For not onely theſe deſcended from the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and from them to the <hi>Hetrurians:</hi> and from them, to the <hi>Latines.</hi> But there had never been (very like) neither faith in, nor practiſe of any ſuch, had not the Artiſts taught, that there are certain lights of praeſagition, deſcending from the coeleſtial bodies, upon all inferiour creatures: as certain ſignes in their motion, ſite, geſture, flight, voice, colour, meat, &amp;c. So that omination, or divination may well be made from the ſimilitude, and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience betwixt them, and the ſtars. For beaſts, and birds, their parts and entrails, their flyings, and cryings, &amp;c. How can theſe (conſidered onely in themſelves) be cauſes of future events? Yea, how can they be ſo much as ſignes? Unleſſe they be taken as effects of ſome other cauſes, that may cauſe, or ſigne future things. And what can they be, but the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial motions? And therefore they muſt prenuntiate future events, in their conformity to the coeleſtial bodies: and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:46899:93"/>to the diſpoſition of the ſtars. So that thus it is, that they are brought to preſage (beſides out of a natural inſtinct, ſuch things as may concern themſelvs, as in ſtorms, and ſhowers) out of a preternatural and aſtral diſpoſition, ſuch ominous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents as may befal others. To have obſerved an old <hi>Augur,</hi> ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the top of his tower, the ayre being cleer, and cloudleſſe, with his <hi>Lituus</hi> in his hand; quartering out the regions of the heavens, &amp;c. who would not have taken him to have been an Aſtrologer? And who would not take our Aſtrologers to be Augurs, and Auſpicinators; that can fancy no more apt and comparable motion of the ſtars: then that the ſtars flit and hover in the heavens, juſt as the birds flie and flutter in the ayre?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether the <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> art, was not the tradition of Rabbiniſh Magicians and Aſtrologers? And what a ſhame is it that Magicians themſelves ſhould tell us, that although the art be old, yet the name and appellation, is but of later in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and not known, till impoſed by, and among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians? But it is well, that they themſelves will acknowledge it, to be a certain <hi>Theurgical Magick,</hi> and nothing elſe but a meer <hi>rapſodie</hi> of ſuperſtition, a play of allegories, and ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of idle brains. And indeed, who can think otherwiſe of it? When they teach, that he who is expert in this Cabaliſtical Magick of names, numbers, letters, characters, ſymbols, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, elements, lines, points, accents, ſpirits, and other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute things, all ſignificative of the profoundeſt ſecrets: he ſhal foreknow, and foretel things future; have power over An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Divels, command whole nature, make all things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him as he will; work miracles, rule the heavens, make the Sun ſtand ſtill, and go back; divide the Sea, dry up Rivers: remove mountains, raiſe the dead, &amp;c. and all this at his own will, and with leſſe then a word.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whether the paganiſh <hi>Oracles</hi> were not founded upon Magick, and Aſtrology, or by Magicians and Aſtrologers? And whether it be not confeſt by them, that they could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, or give anſwer: becauſe the ſtars made not way for them?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whether the art, called the Art <hi>Notorie,</hi> had ever been ſo notorious, but for Magick, and Aſtrologie? A notorious
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:46899:93"/>art indeed: and worthy to be noted with a black coal, or a piece of the blackeſt art, for all the white pretext; Which is, to attain unto ſcience, or knowledge (not onely of things na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and moral, but ſpiritual, and divine) by inſpection of certain figures, and characters, and prolation of certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known words: yea and by ſome pact (ſolemn, or ſecret) with the devil: not without the vain obſervations of certain ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious acts and ceremonies, in faſting, prayers, confeſſions, humiliations, invocations, adorations: upon certain days of the new Moon, about Sun riſing: either in Churches, houſes, barns, fields, or woods. And ſo ſtart upon a ſuddain (by ſome inſpiration or inſuſed ſuggeſtion of an evil ſpirit, prompting the mouth to ſpeak like a Parrot, but not enlightning the mind to apprehend, or underſtand) a preacher, a teacher, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder, a propheſier, predictor, wiſeman, artiſt: and that without any ſtudy, labor, hearing, reading, conference; or other ordinary way of acquiſite learning. And ſo to boaſt himſelf illuminated and inſtructed, like any Prophet, Apoſtle, or Angel of God. And now (it is agreed among themſelves) their Art ſhall no more be called the <hi>Notorious</hi> (for in truth, they neither conceive what they ſay, while they are uttering, nor remember it after they have uttered: nor are able to give any reaſon of their faith or ſcience, that is in them, or comes from them) but the art <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Angelical,</hi> yea the <hi>Pauline art.</hi> For they are now gotten beyond <hi>Solomons</hi> way of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and have already attained to revelation (after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatick and enthuſiaſtick manner) not unlike, nay not unequal to that of <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, when he was wrapt into the third heavens. Of this Diabolical, Magical, Necromantical, Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilegious, Fanatical Art, or injection, fame is common, as concerning a young man (at this day) in our neighbouring Country: which I but onely intimate from the generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, as not being particularly informed thereof. Onely I would ask of our Magical Planetarians, what is the reaſon that they are ſo furious for the rooting out of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry? Is it not becauſe they would ſet up others in their ſtead, according to this their own Art of Ordination?</p>

               <p n="1">1. WHether, as it hath been a great pretext of humane curioſity, ſo it hath not been a great defect of humane incuriouſneſſe; in not diſcerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Prophecy;</hi> but confounding it promiſcuouſly, and ſyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymouſly with other prophane names, and myſteries: As Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:46899:94"/>vaticination, praenotion, omination, ariolation, praeſagition, praediction, prognoſtication, conjectation, &amp;c? All which tearms are either of a bad acceptation; or not good, ſave onely in a civil ſenſe, and that but as touching ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars onely, whereas <hi>Prophecy</hi> ſimply is alwayes taken in the beſt Part: neither is the act of <hi>prophecying;</hi> nor the appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> attributed to any (the whole Scriptures throughout) that are not called and approved of God Unleſſe it be ſo ironically, as that the context, yea and the very adjuncts ſet forth a plain note of difference; that they are only ſo called from their own preſumption; or elſe from a popular repute.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether theſe ſundry differences have not been obſerved concluded, confeſſed, betwixt divine Prophecy and divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all the names, and kinds. <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Prophecy is from <hi>God,</hi> a gift inſpired by the <hi>Holy Spirit:</hi> Divination is from the Devil, a deluſion ſuggeſted by an evil ſpirit. 2: Prophecy was never but according to Gods Covenant; Divination is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domwithout a pact, or covenant with the Devil. 3. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is Gods conſulting with the creature: Divination is the creature conſulting with the creature. or, one is a conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, and not with the creature: the other is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the creature, and not with God. 4. Prophecy is firſt motioned, and freely offered by God: Divination is temptingly, and ſorcerouſly ſought for (as was <hi>Balaams</hi> own way) and not onely provoked, but preſumed alſo. 5. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy hath been concerning ſome ſpecial perſons, and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary actions: Divination (even the Magical, and Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical) is ordinary for all men, their manners, and fortunes. 6. Prophecy hath never been, but of matters weighty, and ſerious: Divination hath often been of things vain, and ludicrous. 7. Prophecy is of thoſe things that are neceſſary to be known: Divination (Magical and Aſtrological) is of thoſe things that are not neceſſary to be known. 8. Prophecy is of thoſe things, that are onely known to God; and cannot be known to others, without Prophecy, or Revelation: Divination is either of thoſe things, that cannot be known by divination; or elſe of thoſe, that may be known without it. 9. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of things true, certain, infallible; becauſe immediately from God, the firſt cauſe: Dvination is of things falſe, and uncertain, and but probable at moſt; becauſe either from the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:46899:95"/>Devil, or but from the creatures, and ſecond cauſes. 10. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy conſiders things in God, and therefore is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable: Divination conſiders things in the creature, and therefore muſt be mutable. 11. No Prophet ever made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the author of his own Prophecy; but <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. But the Devil, and Diviners arrogate their predictions to themſelves, and to the abſoluteneſſe of their own Art. 12. The gift of Prophecy ceaſed in the act: But Divination they wil have to remain ſtill in the Art. 13. Prophecy is not a permanent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but a tranſient act, that the prophets themſelves might know and confeſſe, that they had it not but by gift, and occaſionally according to Gods good pleaſure (<hi>for the prophecy came not at any time by the will of man.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.21.) but Divination, or Aſtrological prediction is a ſtated Art (as they ſay) and they may not onely ſtudy it, but practiſe it at their own wills and pleaſures. 14. It is not for every Prophet to know every thing that is prophecyable: But (for ſo they pretend) it is for any prognoſticator, to know any thing that is prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. 15. Prophets, beſides the Spirit of Prophecy, may have the inſtincts of their own ſpirits, which might ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them: But Diviners, and Prognoſticators, beſides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of their own ſpirit, are obnoxious to Satanical deluſion; whereby they often both are deceived, and do deceive. 16. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy is true in the ground, although it may fail in the effect; becauſe the principle thereof is the prime verity: Divination, though it take effect, yet is it falſe; both becauſe of falſity in the author, and ground, and means, and end. 17. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of things prophecyed, argues no falſhood, or defect in Prophecy; becauſe God may reveal ſome things to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as in their ſecond cauſes, which may be impedited; and ſome things might be propheſyed conditionally, and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they might be prevented; however to be referred to Gods good and wiſe diſpenſation; yea and the Prophets themſelves were inſtructed, and enabled to propheſie as well of their prevention, as of their conſecution: But who can ſay ſo much of Divination? 18. God may (in mercy) ſuffer a true Propheſie to be fruſtrated: and (in judgement) may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a falſe divination to take effect. 19. The Prophets were ſometimes prevented, as touching their predictions of evils, and judgements: But the diviners and falſe prophets were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:46899:95"/>in their predictions of bleſſings, and good things. 20. The Prophets foretold Gods judgements with grief and condoling; wiſhing that they might rather be accounted for falſe Prophets then that ſuch heavy things ſhould befall Gods people tranſgreſſing: the Diviners, and Prognoſticators, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to preſage confuſion to Nations, Kingdomes, Churches, Chriſtians; and are very little touched with the deſtruction of all or any; ſo their predictions may take place. 21. That Prophecy hath been prevented, or failed in effect, was meerly becauſe of the liberty of Gods will: but Divination, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrological prediction, may be defeated even by the liberty of mans will alone. 22. Prophecy, enlightens the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perfects it: ſo does not Divination; but onely (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a confuſed manner) alters the imagination. 23. In Prophecy, it is the intellect that moves the phantaſie: but in Divination, it is the phantaſie that moves the intellect. For Prophecy illuminates immediately, beginning at the mind and heart: which divination cannot do; becauſe it begins at the ſenſes, and ſo to the phantaſie, to the imagination. So that a Prophet underſtands his own Propheſie: ſo doth not a diviner his own divination. 24. Extaſies of Prophets did not ſo abalienate their mindes, as that they apprehended not what they did, or ſaid: as indeed it is in the dementating fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of divination. For theirs was onely but an abſtraction of the minde from outward, ſenſible, and terrene things: not a diſtraction of it within it ſelf; as in theſe. 25. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets mingled godly and wiſe inſtructions, together with their Predictions; that they might not ſeem to neglect the preſent, by prying into the future: both which, are both the ſloath, and buſineſſe of all prognoſticating predictors. 26. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſerve to inſtruct all ages: divinations, inſtead of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, have onely proved to diſtract preſent times, and that's all. 27. The gift or grace of Prophecy was given for the things of Faith, and true worſhip: Divination hath onely been uſed to ſeduce from both. 28. Prophecy was inſpired by God, for the prevention of Idolatry, ſuperſtition, ſorcery: Divination hath been ſuggeſted by the devil, as an occaſion, and promotion of them all. 29. All things are ſubject to prophetical illumination; as things paſt, preſent, and to come,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:46899:96"/>things neceſſary, contingent, caſual; things natural, ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, ſpiritual; things intellectual, rational, arbitrary; things moral, religious, temporal, and eternal: ſo are they not to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vination, or Aſtrological prediction. 30. Prophecy hath been of the very thoughts of the heart themſelves; becauſe immediately from God, who knoweth the heart: but Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can diſcern of no thoughts ſimply, as they are in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect; neither of affections, as they are meerly in the will: but onely gueſſes at them by certain external ſpecies, ſignes, or effects. Yea, though they be thoughts of the devils own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting, yet he diſcerns not their affirmation, or negation (<hi>ſc.</hi> their complacency, or reluctancy) in the immanent act of the underſtanding, or the will: ſave onely as tranſeunt, or break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth externally by certain ſignes and ſymptomes of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and affections. 31. Prophecy is then moſt high and admirable, when it exceeds all humane reaſon: Divination, or any ſuch kinde of prediction, is then moſt vile and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, when it is not ſubject to it. 32. The devil can neither propheſie, nor make prophets: but the devil can both predict and make predictors. 33. Prophecy, as it is not hereditary by nature: ſo neither is it propagatory by art: but Magical divination is the one; and Aſtrological is the other. 34. Prophecy, in obſcureſt things, is ſincere: Divination, in plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things, is equivocal. 35. Prophecy is not venal, or to be bought, and hired with mony, and preferments: as Magical divinations, and Aſtrological predictions are. Neither were the true Prophets mercenary, covetous, ambitious; as the falſe Prophets and Diviners were. 36. Holy men were alwayes humble in the gift of Prophecy: prophane men have been proud of the Art of divination, or prediction. 37. True Prophets never propheſyed things formally falſe: much leſſe thoſe wittingly, and willingly; as falſe Prophets and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have done. 38. True Prophets never hunted the favors of man in place, and power; by flatring predictions even to evil men, and ſad preſages even againſt good men: as Magical and Aſtrological Diviners have alwayes uſed to do. 39. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies were then moſt rigorous, and the Prophets moſt zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; when they themſelves were moſt perſecuted, and deſpiſed: but let Magicians, Necromancers, Diviners, Soothſayers, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunetellers,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:46899:96"/>Gipſies, Juglers, Prognoſticators, and Predictors. &amp;c. be ſeverely examined according to Lawes; and then the ſortilegious ſpirit ſtraightway leavs them. And now, they are able to foreſpeak no mans fate, or deſtiny; they are ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted in ſuſpecting their own. Thus the Art periſhes, in the peril of the Artificer: as the malefice is prevented, or cured in the execution of the Witch. 40. It was a curſe, and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatned as a curſe; for the Church of the Old Teſtament to want her Prophets: but it was a bleſſing, and expreſſely promiſed as a bleſſing, that Diviners, Soothſayers, and all ſuch like, ſhould be expelled out of her. And what faithful man and wiſe, would not think it a like bleſſing to a Chriſtian Church, and Commonwealth? Now, if any man will take the pains to order this accumulation of differences; how eaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly might he obſerve (through various particulars) Prophecy, and Divination, to be two things utterly different in Author, means, matter, form, ſubject, object, end, and effect?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether theſe true ſignes of falſe propheſyings, ſerve not ſufficiently to diſcern falſeneſs, or ſuperſtitiouſneſs of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Aſtrological predictings; As 1. If the propheſying or predicting be of ſuch things, as humane reaſon, or prudence, might juſtly ſuſpect, or eaſily finde out, without it. 2. If it ſerve to ſet open ſuch preſumptions, as are not according to the eternal Law of the written Word. 3. If it pretend to put ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily upon ſuch actions, to which the ordinary rules of the word are a plain guide; and the exhortations a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſpur without it. 4. If it intends falſhood, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of truth: or evil, under a colour of good. 5. If it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly tend to a diſcouraging of vertue, and vertuous men: or an encouraging of vice, and vitious man. 6. If it be of ſome leſſer good, to hinder a greater good. 7. If it be for the uſe of unlawful means, although to ſeeming good ends. 8. If it tend to hereſie, errour, innovation, ſchiſm, and faction in the Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> 9. If to the ſubverſion, or obſtruction of good Lawes in a Chriſtian Commonwealth. 10. If to ſet civil States in a combuſtion; eſpecially ſuch as are Chriſtian. 11. If it be to the advancement of a few; and to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Many: and thoſe as dear children of God; as eminent in parts, and piety; and every way as hopeful, as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:46899:97"/>for Gods glory and the publike good. 12. If the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyer or predictor ſhall preſume himſelf for ſingularly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily choſen out, and ſtirred up, to reveale ſecrets, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a hundred, both of more eminent places, and graces, then himſelf. 13. If he ſhall pride himſelf in a ſingular gift: or prefer it to the favour, and comfort of a ſaving grace. 14. If vain, or corrupt imaginations immediately forego, or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the revelation. 15. If erroneous, inordinate, paſſionate, affected words, and phraſes accompany the delivery, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation thereof. 16. If the perſon of the prophecyer or predictor be noted for idolatry, infidelity, ſuperſtition, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, ſchiſm, athieſm, hypocriſie, prophaneneſs, carnality, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, covetouſneſs, ambition, ſedition, curioſity, vanity, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, ſorcery, envy, flattery, &amp;c. Oh that we did but obſerve theſe, and the like, to examine upon them! Doubtleſs, we might with ſounder judgements, and ſafer Conſciences, pronounce upon our predictors, and their predictions; then either of them could do upon us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the Devil can Prophecy, and Predict? Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie he cannot; for that's to ſpeak from the <hi>Holy Spirit;</hi> which the devil cannot, will not do. Yea it is to ſpeak ſo, <hi>as moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now though the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> may move, or command the devil to ſpeak whether he will or no: yet for him to do it <hi>as moved,</hi> that was not onely to be inſpired, but to receive the inſpiration with approbation; or ſome conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of affection, and intention; which to a devil is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Nevertheleſs, predict he may in ſome things, through the divine both permiſſion and injunction. And but in ſome things. For the devil cannot foreknow, or foretel ſuch things, as depends abſolutely upon Gods wil. Nor yet thoſe things, which depend arbitrarily upon mans own will. Nor the thoughts, and immaginations of mans heart. Nor what entertainments his own ſuggeſtions have there, at their firſt motion. Nor what the good Angels intend. Nor what they are ſent to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the world, or the Church. Nor can he foreſee any thing in it ſelf, nor any thing, that hath not a natural, and particular cauſe. Nor yet what particular impediment may hinder that natural cauſe from effecting. Now I would ask of Magicians, and Aſtrologers; whether they can foreſee, or
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:46899:97"/>foretel more, then the devil himſelf can do? Yet I would ask again; whether the Magical and Aſtrological preſcience, and preſagition, be not much after the ſame manner, as the diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal is? For the devil acquires his, by long obſervation, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten experience of things. He knows well natural cauſes, and can ſee their following effects as preſent in them. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands mens bodily temperaments, and to what paſſions or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections they uſual diſpoſe: and which way mens ſenſitive ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites may ordinarily prevail to incline their wills. He can recollect the wickedneſs of Times, and Nations; and can gueſs by the multitude, lawleſneſs, and impunity of their iniquities among men; how ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r they are to the judgements of God; And accordingly can conjecture, and predict the puniſhment of a people; by war, famine, peſtilence, &amp;c. He can certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foretel theſe things, that depend upon neceſſary cauſes; and have no other natural cauſe to hinder them: as the motions of the ſtars, Eclipſes, conjunctions, &amp;c. But if they be not neceſſary (although falling out for the moſt part) but may have ſome other natural cauſes hindring them: thoſe he can foretel but probably, and by conjecture; as ſhowers, ſtorms, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, &amp;c. He can certainly foretel thoſe malefices, which (by Gods permiſſion) he intends to act, either by himſelf, or by his ſworn inſtruments. He can diſcloſe ſuch corrupt cogitations as himſelf hath injected: eſpecially ſo far forth, as he obſerved them to take impreſſion with complacency. And for ſecret luſts, manners, and actions (ſuch as himſelf hath been an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate witneſſe of) he can reveal them to his Magical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and make them (if God will permit) object them to mens faces, and bewray them to the world. He is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo going to and fro in the earth, that he can tel what is doing even in remoteſt places: and (ſuch is his agility) can ſuddenly convey it to his abſent inſtruments, or Artiſts; and make them relate it as if they were preſent. Hidden treaſures, loſt goods, thefts, murders ſecretly committed; theſe (becauſe done in his preſence, and kept in his remembrance) he can diſcloſe to, and by his Agents; if men will conſult, and God give leave. Yea, he can preſage many things from the prophecies of the Word; whoſe hiſtoricall part he underſtands better then men.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:46899:98"/>
               <p n="5">5. Why God permits the devil and Diviners oft times to predict things future? Is it not to diſtinguiſh betwixt his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, ſpiritual, and ſaving graces: and his extraordinary, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, and tranſient gifts? That none might preſume of an inlightened minde, or a conformed will: becauſe of ſuch acts as may be without the leaſt touch, either of the one or the other? Nor arrogate to themſelves a likeneſs to Angels, for ſuch preſagitions, as wherein the beaſts may ſurpaſs them? Is it not, that ungodly men and profane may thus ſo much the more be given over to their own ſuperſtitions, and diabolical deluſions? And to teach the faithful, and godly, not to covet, affect, admire, or undiſcreetly approve of thoſe gifts: which are no perpetual and infallible tokens of Gods grace, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Eſpecially, neither to be acting in, nor attending to, thoſe vain curioſities; which <hi>Satan</hi> may ſuggeſt, and wicked men and infidels may attain unto.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether the devil or divining predictors, ought to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, ſhould they foretel truth? <hi>The Devil abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him. When he ſpeaketh a lye, he ſpeaketh of his own: for he is a lyar, and the father of it.</hi> Joh. 8.44. <hi>Eve</hi> ought not to have believed him, becauſe he ſpake of his own, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Ahab</hi> was not bound to be <hi>perſwaded</hi> by him, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20, 21, 22. Becauſe though he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or permiſſion from God; yet he exceeded it, and ſpake of his own. But I make a queſtion whether <hi>Saul</hi> ought not to have believed him; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.19. Becauſe he now ſpake not of his own. God is to be believed even in the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But then, it might be evident, that he not onely ſpeaks the things of God, but from God: that is, both the truth, and by a ſpecial warrant. Otherwiſe, there's no accepting of his Teſtimony (be it never ſo true) if he take it up of his own Authority. And therefore our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> would neither aſſent to, nor approve of the Devils, although they ſpake the truth, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.24, 25. &amp; 3.11, 12. No more did St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the truth that was ſpoken by <hi>the Spirit of Divination, Act.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. We are taught, that <hi>Satan</hi> may transform himſelf into an Angel of light, and ſo may his Miniſters like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. And therefore we held our ſelves not obliged ſimply to believe either the one, or the other; even in the beſt they can
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:46899:98"/>ſay. Becauſe they may lye, in telling truth; may tell truth, to deceive; may prejudice a greater, in uttering a leſſer truth; may uſurp it of themſelves; may arrogate it to themſelves. When did God ſend the devil on a meſſage, to inſtruct his Church in the truth; or to promiſe good unto his children? If he be ſent extraordinarily to pronuntiate to the wicked, and reprobates, their deſtinated judgements, and deſerts; they may be ſo conſcious within themſelves, as to have cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. But as for holy men, and elect, if they be not tyed to believe their truth, how much rather ought they to take heed of their ſtrong deluſions, as not to believe their lyes?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether a wicked man may propheſie: or a godly man divine? Although godly men are more ſubject to wicked mens ſins, then wicked men are capable of godly mens graces; Yet godly men (as godly men) cannot be infected with wicked mens divining: neither can wicked men (as wicked men) be endowed with godly mens prophecying. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is pretended to <hi>divine:</hi> yet is it but a pretence, of a pretence; if it be taken in the worſt ſenſe, as hath been ſaid before. <hi>Balaam took up his parable</hi> (a dark ſaying, which he himſelf underſtood not) and <hi>God put a word in his mouth</hi> (which never affected his heart) But <hi>Balaam</hi> had no more the gift, and ſpirit of propheſying, then his <hi>Aſſe</hi> had the gift, and ſpirit of ſpeaking. May we not then determine it thus? God may be pleaſed ſo to diſpenſe prophecying, as ſometimes to prompt a wicked man with the act, ſound, or prolation of it: but inſpires, or indues godly men alone with the gift, ſenſe, and ſpirit of prophecy. For the ſpirit of prophecy delights in ſanctity, and purity. And to perfect prophecy is required, not onely the illumination of the minde; but the aſſent alſo of the will (as to Gods revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, authority, pleaſure, meſſage, truth, glory) which indeed cannot be in an ungodly man. In Scripture a <hi>good man,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> are Synonyma's: and <hi>a man of God,</hi> and a <hi>Prophet,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible terms. And a bad man is never ſo called, but with ſome epithete betokening the abuſive appellation. Goodneſs of manners, though it neceſſarily prepares not of it ſelf, to the acquiſition of prophecy (becauſe it is a free, ſudden, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary inſult, or illapſe) Yet badneſſe of manners is alwayes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:46899:99"/>of it ſelf, an utter impediment. Onely, God may be pleaſed (in ſuch ſingular acts) ſo to abalienate, or ſuſpend corruptions for the preſent, as ſometimes to make good uſe of ill inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for others ſakes: but not often, or for their own; as he hath been been pleaſed to act with thoſe, whoſe hearts he hath changed, and renewed.</p>
               <p n="8">8. How chance the Prophets that prophecyed not onely by words, but by Facts, and by Signes alſo (and by ſo many, and ordinary Signes) yet none of them, once prophecyed from the ſtars, or their conſtellations? Was not that vertue in them? Or was it not obſerved in them, in their time? Were they fain to make uſe of terreſtrial ſignes, becauſe the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtials were out of their reach? Nay, was it not to let us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, That God, and his Prophets could make the meaneſt ſignes upon earth, to confirm their Prophecies: whereas the devil and diviners are not able to make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſignes in Heaven, to confirm their Prognoſtications? Why did <hi>Chriſt</hi> refuſe to ſhew <hi>a ſigne from Heaven,</hi> in proof of his <hi>Meſſiahſhip?</hi> Matt. 16.1, 4. Becauſe they ſought it; and ſought it temptingly, and ſought it for themſelves. They would have ſignes among ſignes, and miracles among mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and ſuch ſignes and miracles as they themſelves fancyed; and ſuch as might aſſimilate their own prognoſticating ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and vain obſervation; and ſuch a ſigne, as was not prophecyed, that the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſhould do; and ſuch as had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſt cauſe, neceſſity, nor end, for which they ſhould deſire it. Beſides, that the Prophets revealed nothing from the ſtars; and <hi>Christ</hi> denyed to make any ſuch demonſtration of himſelf, his doctrine, and miracles; becauſe it was not prophecyed of him: and therefore he refers them onely to a prophecyed ſign, <hi>the ſigne of the prophet Jonas:</hi> enough to ſignifie, of how little neceſſity all ſydereal obſervation, or operation is to pure Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy. But I demand further; if there were any congruity, or conſiſtency betwixt Prophecy, and mag-aſtro-mancy; why then was the one a ſingular, extraordinary, and temporary gift to Gods people, and the other made a common Art, or Trade, to Idolators, Infidels, and men prophane?</p>
               <p n="9">9. Whether Prophecy be natural? Or yet of any artificial preparation? The Occult Philoſophizers, Magical Mirabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:46899:99"/>and aſtral Fabricators, are for both (yea beſides the ſeed of the ſoul, and the humours of the body, they pretend the parts of beaſts, ſtones, herbs, and outward ceremonies, all to be effectually diſpoſing to Prophecie.) But the truth is for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For Prophecy indeed is not natural, but ſupernatural: not artificial, or acquiſite; but infuſed, or inſpired. Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is immediate, ſudden, momentany; the diſpoſition (at one inſtant) infuſed together with the act: yea and the very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpoſition ceaſing, when the particular act ceaſeth. It never finds it ſubject capable to receive it, but makes it ſo: neither leaves it in the leaſt capacity to acquire, or expect it preſently again. But if it pleaſe to return, it ſtill makes its own way (oft times another, a new way) for it ſelf. What inclination of nature, or preparation of Art doth it require; when it can take the ignorant, as well as the learned; the <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot,</hi> as well as the <hi>Artiſt;</hi> yea a corrupt heart, and a falſe mouth and nevertheleſſe make it foreſpeak its own infallible truth? No nature or eſſence is prophetical of it ſelf, but that which is incomprehenſible, and comprehending all things. If our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had any ſuch inclination in it ſelf; why ſhould we not all propheſie? And alwayes propheſie? And propheſie when we pleaſe? And propheſie of one thing as well as another? And one propheſie, as well as another? To whom then ſhould we propheſie? And how ſhould our pronuntiating be of thoſe things, which are hidden to the common ſenſe, and ordinary apprehenſion of men, among whom we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant? How ſhould Prophecy be ſaid to exceed all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cognition; if it may proceed from any natural inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? And how ſhall we diſtinguiſh betwixt Prophecie, which hath revealed, and reveals things, as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and prognoſtication, which (at moſt) can but predict ſome things, as they are in their natural cauſes, and diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? What praevious diſpoſition to propheſie (either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or artificially) was there in <hi>Ames,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>I was no prophet, neither was I a prophets ſon; but I was an heardman, and a gatherer of ſycomore fruit. And the Lord took me, as I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the flock, and the Lord ſaid unto me, Go prophecy. Amos</hi> 7.14, 15. As for <hi>Eliſha's</hi> calling for a <hi>Minſtrel:</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.15. This was not to procure, or excite propheſie: but to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:46899:100"/>ſedate paſſions and affections; and ſo make himſelf fitter for contemplation and devotion. Not as if (according to the Rabbinical conceit) the ſpirit of Prophecie had now made its receſſe from him, becauſe of ſome perturbation of his, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo exaſperated againſt <hi>Jehoram;</hi> For that was a true zeal of God, and that is never inordinate: neither ſerves it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but promote Gods gifts. But ſay he had been ſomewhat diſquieted, and diſtracted from the ſpirit of Prophecie; how was it in the force and vertue of Muſick to reſtore it? Muſick could do that neither naturally, nor artificially: if it did it at all, it muſt do it miraculouſly. The prophets very calling for Muſick, was a propheſie; Signifying that the ſpirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie reſts not in turbulent, diſtracted, factious, ſeditious minds: but in harmonious, unanimous, appeaſed, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hearts. But let them contend Prophecie to be of natural diſpoſition, and artificial preparation; that would ſo take off theirs, from being thought diabolical: what need we do ſo, that hold Prophecie to be wholly divine? Nature, and Art cannot ſo much credit the Aſtrological, as they prejudice the Theological propheſie.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Whether Propheſie be not now ceaſt? It was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be perpetual. Even while it was, it was an act; not an habit: not permanent, but tranſient. The Spirit now in the illapſe, and again upon the receſſe. It was a gift or grace, not ſo much perſonal, as vocational: pertaining not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary duty ſo much, as extraordinary occaſion. Nor was it ſo neceſſary, that men ſhould be taught to look after things future: as how to uſe the preſent time aright. The prophets were but types of that <hi>great Prophet:</hi> and all propheſie had its main end, and completion in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It was therefore meet that the ſhadow ſhould recede, now that the ſubſtance came in place; Prophecy was neceſſary for the Church of the Old-Teſtament, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not yet come: but not ſo in this of the New; becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> is come already. We have an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal propheſie, abundantly recompencing that lack of the legal: being a gift or grace not extraordinary, but ordinary; not temporary, but perpetual; not ſingular, but univerſal; not vocational onely, but perſonal; not an act common to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but an habit peculiar to the Saints. Not of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:46899:100"/>things of future times: but of expounding the future things of eternity. Be it in heaven or earth; <hi>Prophecies ſhall fail, when that which is perfect is come,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.8. In heaven, they muſt needs fail; becauſe there's no future to be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated, or expected; all is an eternal preſent. And in the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they muſt needs fail; becauſe there is no future truth (not another Goſpel) to be expected; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent truth is eternal. Prophecie failed in the Church, as did the other extraordinary, and temporary gifts: <hi>viz.</hi> Working of miracles, and ſpeaking with Tongues. Nevertheleſſe I conceive, God hath abſolutely denyed his Church none of all theſe: but that the Spirit may be pleaſed to ſtir up ſome men, at ſome times, and to ſome particulars, to act in any of them; if juſt cauſe and neceſſity be. Yet, though a man ſhould be raiſed to propheſie now, and that by the ſame Spirit; I cannot think it to be by the ſame degree, or authority of the Spirit as the former Prophets were. Becauſe the authority of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in them, was not onely prophetical, or hiſtorical: but ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piential, and dogmatical. And ſo their propheſies were recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not onely for a particular and certain prediction of truth: but for an univerſal, and perpetual inſtruction of Faith. And therefore, either there muſt be no end of adding to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: or elſe none ſuch muſt now be raiſed. There may be ſome prudential predictings of good men; and ſuſpicious preſagings of evil men; and ſhrewd conjecturings of common men: but what are all theſe to the propheſyings of holy men of God in old time? Yet we ſay, Gods hand is not ſhortned, but that he can ſtill raiſe up ſuch: but who can ſay, that he will do it? Or that there is juſt cauſe why he ſhould ſo do? We conclude therefore, in the general, that Prophecy is ceaſt. And that of an extraordinary gift at firſt; it is become more extraordinary to after ages. What reaſon then have we to be ſo blind of Faith; as to admit of a ſtated art of divination in its ſtead?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>From the rarity of Miracles.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="1">1 WHether every thing that is affected above, beſides, or againſt the courſe and order, faculty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hope and expectation of nature; may truly be ſaid to be miraculous? Not every thing. 1. Becauſe, it is not a thing effected againſt particular nature, but againſt whole nature, that makes a Miracle. 2. Becauſe in particular nature, there are antipolliges, or occult qualities of actives and paſſives; naturally acting, or diſpoſed to act one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. Becauſe it is neither nature acting contrary to ſome part of her ſelf; nor is it Art urging or tempting Nature: but it is God totally exceeding the law, vertue, and order of Nature; that makes it to be a Miracle. 4. Becauſe many things may be done againſt Nature, or natural propenſity; which notwithſtanding are but ordinary and trivial; as the cauſing of heavy things to aſcend upwards, &amp;c. 5. Becauſe there are many ſins and vices, that are againſt Natures law and vertue, which who will ſay that they are miraculous? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we conclude againſt Magical Mirabilaries? that although every Miracle be an act or effect above Nature: yet every act or effect beſides, or againſt Nature, is not a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whether that may abſolutely be ſaid to be a Miracle, whoſe effect is manifeſt; and whoſe cauſe is occult or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us? No. Except it be acted ſimply by the firſt cauſe; and for cauſes onely known to him. 2. Except it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all mans exact knowledge indifferently; one as well as another. 3. Except the cauſe be altogether paſt ſuch finding out, even to ſober and prudential obſervation, art, induſtry. Otherwiſe, it ſhould not be a Miracle, ſo as it is in it ſelf, but ſo as it appears to us. Our ignorance ſhould neceſſarily come
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:46899:101"/>into the cauſe of Miracles. That ſhould be miraculous to one man; which is not ſo to another. And a prophane curioſity of Art would boaſt of more light, and experiment in divine works: then indeed is vouchſafed to the perſwaſion of a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whether the power of working Miracles be not proper to God alone? This muſt be affirmed, and cannot be denyed. 1. Becauſe He onely can work a Miracle of himſelf, to whom nothing is a Miracle. 2. Becauſe He onely can work againſt the order of Nature, and ſecond cauſes, whoſe will is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to inſtitute, Order, alter all things. 3. Becauſe God is a tranſcendent, and is not under, nor yet within the predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of any part of the whole order of Nature; as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is: and therefore he onely can act that againſt, and beſides above the order of Nature; which the creature cannot. 4. Becauſe a divine power requires not a ſubject to work upon (for it is able to create all things of nothing) neither looks it at the poſſibility, or propenſity of that ſubject, to the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the effect, as every created power doth. 5. Becauſe the proper cauſe of a Miracle muſt not onely be uncreated, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, omnipotent, indeterminate, &amp;c. But it muſt alſo be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, unſearchable, incomprehenſible: now no cauſe is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo; but the hidden God himſelf. 6. Becauſe it cannot be a Miracle, unleſs it be abſolutely, and univerſally wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; or to be equally admired of all creatures of the ſame kinde. Now it is onely for God; and neither for Angels, or men, to do ſuch things, as ſhall be admirable to their fellows, and not ſo to themſelves. 7. Becauſe if any other could work Miracles but God, or but by God, then Miracles could not be the indubitable ſignes, and proofs of a God; nor of Gods Word, and Truth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whether the good Angels can do Miracles? Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and inſtrumentally they may: but not principally and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively. For Angels are finite both in their nature, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and power. And divine Miracles (abſolutely conſidered) are as ſtrange and wonderful to them: as they are to us men. Yet Angels (out of the vertue and perſpicuity of their own nature) may know how to do many things, that may ſeem miraculous, or be marveilous to us. Becauſe they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:46899:102"/>are a ſuperior power or vertue unknown to us; and may have a particular power (over inferiours) not known to us; and therefore may act above, beſides, againſt the particular order of Nature, that is known to us. But being part of whole cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nature themſelves, they cannot act againſt it (the main reaſon of a Miracle) for ſo they ſhould act againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whether Devils can do Miracles? If not Angels; much leſſe devils. Neither doth the Lord make uſe of the devils to be inſtruments of his mighty works; as he doth of the Angels. For Miracles were never intended or effected (immediately or mediately) but for the confirmation of the truth: to which the devils are no apt inſtruments; becauſe all that they do is with intent to ſeduce therefrom. The devils indeed have a faculty, and ſagacity (both much enabled by long experience in things) above us men: and ſo may work (in many things) to amaze, as well as delude us. But ſuch ſtupendous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious facts, as they (by divine permiſſion) buſie themſelves about, are no true Miracles: becauſe falſe, either as touching the reality of the effect; or elſe the ſincerity of the intent. And for the reality of effect, it is not ſo much thanks to their admirable power, or manner of working, as to the natural (though ſecret) diſpoſition of the matter they work upon. Neither are they permitted often to work any reality of effect (but onely to delude with preſtigious appearances) becauſe God ſeldom ſuffers Nature, or the creature to be ſo blemiſhed, or abuſed. And though they had a liberty to effect really, in things to be admired: yet (ſo falſe is their diſpoſition) they would chuſe, and labour to be preſtigious. And where they are tempted (or urged as they ſay, by Art) to do thoſe things that are not within their power, or permiſſion: there are they forced to be preſtigious, and deluſory; for the ſaving of their credit amongſt their own. Now this preſtigiouſneſſe or illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion (whether freely from themſelves, or as it were forced by others) is a ſigne of their impotency, as well as their fallacy: and either of them are a ſufficient argument to exclude them utterly from a power of working Miracles. And therefore, if they will needs be contending for the devils power in, and by Magicians, Aſtrologers, Necromancers Conjurers,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:46899:102"/>Witches, &amp;c. We leave both them, &amp; theirs, to their <hi>lyingwonders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Whether there be any ſuch ſecrets in Nature, as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to work Miracles? Although it be confeſt, that there are ſundry admirable ſecrets hidden in Natures boſome: yet we muſt profeſſe, that her hand is here ſhortned. Becauſe it is the nature of a Miracle to exceed Natures power. It muſt be above, beſides, againſt Nature: and not particular onely, but univerſal, or whole created Nature. Though a Miracle be wrought in Nature, yet it muſt be quite beyond Natures prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, law, order. Nature of it ſelf muſt not ſo much as incline or diſpoſe to it. Yea it muſt be in the very nature of the thing to be otherwiſe, then the Miracle hath made it. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, the more alien the effect is to Nature, and the more remore from Natures order: the greater is the Miracle, and the more to be admired. Wherefore we conclude (againſt thoſe <hi>Mirions,</hi> who would make themſelves to be Natures Apes) that not onely any particular nature, is not able to worke a Miracle beſides, or againſt the order of whole Nature: but the vertue even of whole Nature, is not able to worke a Miracle upon any particular nature whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Whether Miracles may be wrought by Art? The flat Negative is to be concluded upon theſe Arguments. 1. Art cannot exceed Nature. Now Nature (in all her mirables) is but Miracles Ape; and Art is but Natures Ape: what then are the Magical Mirabilaries (at moſt) but Apes of Art? 2. The ſtrength of Art is acquiſite: the vertue of Miracles is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. 3. An Art operates onely according to reaſon and knowledge: but a Miracle altogether above them. 4. Art effects nothing, but according to ordinary rules, obſervations, experiments, cuſtoms: but a Miracle is ſo extraordinary, that it were no Miracle, except it were effected contrary to all theſe. 5. Art (for the moſt part) is of neceſſaries: a Miracle (for the moſt part) is of contingents. 6. If Art ſerved to worke Miracles, then were the power of them acquiſite, arbitrary, of mans will, and induſtry: yea one man might do Miracles as well as another. 7. None of Gods ſervants ever wrought Miracles by Art. 8. If it were in the Artiſts power, it ſhould be a Miracle to one man, and not to another. 9. Prophane men, and the greateſt tempters of God, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:46899:103"/>and Nature, ſhould ſo do moſt Miracles. 10. Art rather ſerves to prevent many things for ſeeming Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: becauſe it helps to finde out the ſuddain cauſe. For either it lets to underſtand the cauſe, or not: if it doth not, then it is no Art; if it doth, then it is no Miracle.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whether it be lawful, neceſſary, convenient (not onely for the working of Miracles, but for the finding out of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables) to operate (either by Art, or violence) againſt the order plac't in Nature? Doubtleſſe, it is no further lawful; then it may be either neceſſary, or convenient. That is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, and directly tending to ſome publike, or private uſe, or benefit. Nature may have many pretty mirables (which they title <hi>Admired Auditions, Natural hiſtory, Mirables of the world, Occult Miracles of Nature, Occult Philoſophie, ſubtilities and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of things, ſecrets, myſteries, memorables, unheard of curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> &amp;c.) Yet for all that, are they not ſuch, as Magicians fain, or fable, in animals, plants, herbs, ſtones, &amp;c. Nor are they (a many of them) ſo mirable in themſelves; as either to mens fancies, or ignorances. Her actives, and paſſives, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies, and antipathies, are ſo occult and profound: as who can tell where to finde them; or how to apply them; ſo as to urge Nature (by the help of Art) to worke wonders? Who can do ſuch a thing (eſpecially make it his trade, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, oſtentation, ſo to do) and not be ſubject to, or guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tempting God, provoking the Devil, tormenting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, abuſing the creature, loſing time, diſparaging himſelf, and deluding the world? It is for none but God to worke ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely againſt the order of whole created Nature: becauſe he could have inſtituted another order of Nature. And all things are ſubject to him; not ſo much from a neceſſity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſecond cauſes: as according to the abſoluteneſſe of his own power, and liberty of his own will. And it is for none to undertake to alter the order of particular Nature; but in, by, under, and for God: yea (I may ſay) according to God; and not otherwiſe. As. 1. God acteth not againſt the order of nature (in any particular of it) ſave onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt and weighty cauſes: how then dare prophane men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to do ſuch a thing joculatorily, jugglingly, to make ſport and paſtime; or yet for no other end or uſe, but vain and idle
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:46899:103"/>experiments ſake; or onely to feed, or ſatisfie vain and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous curioſity? 2. God, though he may act againſt that order which one creature hath to another: yet acts he not againſt that order, which the creature hath to himſelf. For ſhould he act againſt the order of nature, as it depends upon himſelf; he ſhould ſo act againſt himſelf: in like manner, neither ought man to act againſt the order of nature, or of the creature ſo far forth as it depends upon God; nor yet ſo far forth as it is not intended by God, to be ſerviceable and uſeful unto men. 3. God acts not againſt the law and courſe of nature, ſo as to violate his own great Law; <hi>ſo</hi> that of his wiſdome, goodneſſe, juſtice, in diſpoſing the creature: neither ought men ſo to do, beyond the great Law of uſing the creature aright, and to thoſe very ends for which God ordained it. For it can never be lawful or warrantable, ſo to tranſgreſſe natures order, as to abuſe the creature in any kinde. Now do they not know, that the creature may as well be ſpiritually, and ſpeculatively abuſed, by ſuperſtition, and curioſity: as practically, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, by violence, or ſenſuality.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Why, amongſt all the Miracles that <hi>Chriſt</hi> wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devils, among men, and in the other creatures: he did work none at all from, or by the heavenly bodies, the ſtars? Beſides the reaſon above mentioned, why he refuſed to ſhew <hi>a ſigne from heaven;</hi> this may now be added above all the reſt. It was becauſe there now was a greater Miracle wrought upon the earth, then ever was wrought in the Heavens. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the myſterious Miracle, or miraculous Myſtery of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi> Doing ſuch works upon earth, as whereat the Angels, and whole powers of heaven might well ſtand amazed with admiration. Indeed there was a wonder in Heaven, <hi>a ſtar</hi> (a new ſtar) at his birth: and another wonder in Heaven, an <hi>Eclipſe of the Sun</hi> (a new Eclipſe) at his death. Such a ſtar, and ſuch an Eclipſe, as were miracles (in their nature, ſite, motion, portent) to all other ſtars, and Eclipſes. Such a ſtar, and ſuch an Eclipſe, as were the myſteries of all other ſtars and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſes. Set apart to ſignifie his power in Heaven, at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt inſtants of his infirmity upon earth. Thus they teſtified of him; and yet was not among theſe Miracles, nor mighty works that were wrought by him.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:46899:104"/>
               <p n="10">10 Whether Miracles may be wrought out of the Church. Although we make not the power of working miracles to be the perpetual note of Gods Church: yet we determine the Church to be the proper ſeat of them. And in determining, we do thus diſtinguiſh; That God may be pleaſed to work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles all the world over; and that by his Angles, as his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Government thereof: but employs not men to that purpoſe, ſave onely within his Church. And do diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh again, that privative miracles, or thoſe of wrath and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be wrought out of the Church: but not poſitive, or thoſe of Grace and mercy. And our reaſons are. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the main end of working Miracles is for the plantation and confirmation of the Goſpel, the truth of Gods word: and that cannot be without the Church. 2. The power of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Miracles is from a promiſe, and that belongs to the Church alone. 3. In a Miracle is conſiderable not ſo much the evident effect as the ſecret intent, and this conſideration is onely for the faithful in the Church. 4. The truth of the word is not to be meaſured by miracles; but the truth of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by the Word: and where is that but in the Church? 5. Miracles tend as to the glory of God, ſo to the edification of the Godly; and who looks for that or them, out of Gods Church. 6. Satans ſtupendous prodigies are moſtly wrought out of the Church: but Gods wonderful miracles within it. 7. Though it hath been ſaid, that miracles were intended for Infidels; yet were they not effected but by believers: and by believers, either to convince, or to convert thoſe Infidels.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Whether wicked men and reprobates may be workers of miracles? Not by Angelical aſſiſtance, not by diabolical confederation, not by the ſecret of Nature, not by the ſtudy of Art: but by divine diſpenſation they may. 1. Becauſe God may be pleaſed to employ them to this purpoſe; and yet give them no more but a faith of miracles; which is common to reprobates. 2. Becauſe that of miracles is a gift not ſimply making accepted: but may be given onely for others ſakes. 3. God hath wrought miracles by dead inſtruments: and why not by men of a dead faith, and dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes? 4. Wicked men may be uſed in the working of miracles, for a teſtimony of Gods truth: yet not in a manifeſtation of their
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:46899:104"/>own graces. 5. Bad men have been imployed in working of miracles: that good men might not be proud, or overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of common gifts. 6. The working of miracles is not appropriated to godly men: leſt ordinary Graces might be undervalued; and weak Chriſtians might take ſcandal, and deſpair in their defect of the extraordinary gift.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Wherein differ true and falſe miracles: or divine and diabolical; Theological, and magical? 1. The one kind are wrought by God, by Angels, Prophets, Apoſtles, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the Saints: the other not but by devils, magicians, Juglers, ungodly men. 2. The one are ſolid and real in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: the other are phantaſmatical, and praeſtigiouſly deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſenſe. 3. The one God freely calls to do: the other are not done but by tempting both God, and the Devil. 4. The one are ſerious, and upon occaſions of importance: the other are ludicrous, and ſerve to make vain men ſport. 5. The one tend to confirm the Church: the other to ſeduce from it. 6. The one are liberal: the other mercenary. 7. The one profitable: the other pernicious. 8. The one make humble and modeſt: the other arrogant and full of oſtentation. 9. The one ſerves to inſtruct: the other onely to aſtoniſh. 10. The one are wrought with devout Prayer, Supplication, Thankſgiving: the other by ſuperſtitious imprecation, adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, incantation; with many ridiculous ſignes, and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ceremonies, nothing pertaining to the producing of the effect. And thus they differ in their Authors, inſtruments, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity quality, duration, utility, end, and effect.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Whether Magicians, Conjurers, Inchanters, Witches, &amp;c work not their miracles, (or rather ſignes, wonders, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies, portents) by the devils means? It is affirmed that they do ſo, for theſe reaſons. 1. Becauſe they do them not by God, Angels, Nature, or Art (as appears ſufficiently by what hath been ſaid already) and therefore they muſt needs do them by the devil. 2. Becauſe they operate upon a compact: which is evident in that invocation, adoration, ſacrifice, immolation, &amp;c. is hereunto required. 3. Becauſe they operate by idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ſuperſtitious, ſorcerous, execrable, ridiculous ſignes, rites and ceremonies. 4. Becauſe they ſecretly invoke, although they outwardly would ſeem to command: which implorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:46899:105"/>and imperiouſneſſe, yea and diſſimulation between both theſe, is to God, and good Angels, abominable. 5. Becauſe their Prayers and preparations are blaſpheming, railing, exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating, threatning, prophane, ſuperſtitious, abſurd, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous: which neither God nor good Angel can indure. 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeek either to allure, or compel their operating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by things ſenſible. 7. Becauſe the fact exceeding Natures order, and Arts efficacy: yet there can be no reaſonable cauſe why ſuch an effect ſhould be aſcribed either to God, or good Angels. 8. Becauſe the effect is by them aſcribed to times, places, figures, characters, rites ceremonies, &amp;c. 9. Becauſe there are uſed hereunto words (beſides names of God, and Angels) barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, unknown, inſignificant, incoherent, apocryphal, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, ſorcerous, detorted, abſurd, ridiculous, &amp;c. 10. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they make uſe of means unlawful, unapt, and not ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſuch a purpoſe. 11. Becauſe they do their feats upon vain and light occaſions. 12. Becauſe they effect that (or ſeem ſo to do) at a diſtance: which the cauſes themſelves could not naturally do, were they proximately applyed. 13. Becauſe their miracles or wonders are not wrought, but at certain times, in certain places, and by certain means: as under ſuch conſtellations, by ſuch configurations, by ſuch animal parts, ſtones, herbs, preparations, confections, &amp;c. 14. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſeem to make many cautions in the preparation; which they violate in the execution. As they caution to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, chaſtity, temperance, ſobriety, juſtice, charity, &amp;c. yet the exerciſe is wholly of, and to the contrary. 15. Becauſe they are not onely ungodly men that do them: but they do them for wicked ends: As idolatry, murder, theft, covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luſts, pride, ambition, vain-glory, &amp;c. 16. Becauſe if there be any truth or reality of extraordinary effect, either through natures ſecret diſpoſition, or Arts ſtudious operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yet diabolical ſuggeſtion intervenes, and prompts the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to mingle many vanities and fallacies of ſignes and ceremonies, whereby to delude and deceive. 17. Becauſe they are ſeldome or never ſo prodigious and ſtupendous in effecting; as in troubled and diſtracted States. 18. Becauſe their monſtrous prodigies &amp; portents are moſtly wrought out of the Church, or in falſe and heretical Churches, or where
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:46899:105"/>the Church is declining, and flitting; or elſe to the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, prejudice, perſecution of the true Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. Whether there be any verity, or reality of miraculous effect, in thoſe things that are miridically done by the Devill, and Magicians: Reallity of effect there may be ſeen; but of miraculous effect none: That is, there may be ſome reall effect upon the patient indirectly, and conſequentially (as in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation, ſorcery, effaſcination) although there be none ſuch primarily, and directly, as from a miraculous Agent. For we ſee that men are really affected, and terrified, even from ſpectrous and ludibrious phantaſmes. Our concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſtated, ſtands firm, for theſe proofes. 1. The Devill and Magicians cannot doe that which is poſſible to neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, nor to both of them together, (no though they had all the Angels joyned to them) that is, to worke true miracles. 2. God ſeldome or never permits. and the devill ſeldome or never intends, any verity and reallity of effect in ſuch caſes; Becauſe he delights to be a falſe emulator, but no true imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Gods workes. 3. If there be produced (at any time) any reallity of effect; it is not beyond the ſecret diſpoſition of the matter they worke in; then which nothing can bee more defective to the forme of a miracle. 4. All their mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous transformations, and tranſportations are but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract one thing (by a ſwift and imperceptible motion) and ſubſtitute another in the place; and ſo either delude the phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, or deceive the ſight. 5. Thoſe mutations, or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they worke, are but by actives and paſſives artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally applyed; which though nature alone would not have produced peradventure; yet art alone could never have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them, without ſome naturall property or capacity thereunto in nature. So that the vertue of effecting is ſimply and primarily in the naturall power, or property; and but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, and conditionally, in the artificiall or cunning application. 6. All their repreſentations, and oſtentations are phantaſmaticall and ſpectrous; either in reſpect of the preſtigious tranſpoſition of the object, the organ, or the meane. 7. The intent and end of ſuch their operations are repugnant to true and faithfull profeſſion, and holy and righteous converſation; and ſerving only to inſinuate or
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:46899:106"/>confirme a lie; and therefore muſt be but <hi>lying wonders</hi> at moſt.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Whether thoſe things that were done by <hi>Pharaohs Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians,</hi> in emulation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were miraculous, and real in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; as his were? Some contend they were ſo: but others (upon better grounds) conclude they were otherwiſe. For 1. What <hi>Moſes</hi> did, he did at the <hi>call</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.6. But the Magicians did theirs at the <hi>call</hi> or <hi>command</hi> of <hi>Pharaob,</hi> verſ. 11. And therefore ſeeing there was not the ſame Authority of doing miracles; doubtleſſe there was not the like efficacy between them, or miraculous effect. 2. <hi>The Magicians of Egypt,</hi> though it be ſaid, <hi>they alſo did ſo, or in like manner:</hi> yet it is to be underſtood <hi>in ſpecie, non jure;</hi> in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but not indeed. Becauſe it is added (by way of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing) <hi>with their inchantments,</hi> verſ. 11. And the original word ſome derive from a root that ſignifies to flame, becauſe with fiery flaſhings, and flamings, they uſed to perſtringe the eyes of the beholders: and not onely ſo; but was hereby the greateſt incendiaries, inflaming mens minds with idolatry, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, lies, and calumnies, &amp;c. Others derive it from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther root, that ſignifies involving, covering, hiding; to note, with what occult and involved ſlights and covertures, they ſought to conceal their preſtigious pranks; ſo as they might appear otherwiſe then indeed they were. Beſides, the word is ocmmonly uſed (in Hebrew Authors) to ſignifie diabolical and preſtigious works. 3. True miraculous effects may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and concord together; and never oppoſe, or deſtroy one another: it is a ſign of falſe circulatory phantaſms, that they are ſoon vaniſhing, and diſperſing, when they preſume to come in competition with true divine miracles. Thus <hi>Aarons rod ſwallowed up the rods of the Magicians,</hi> verſ. 12. Whether his rod did ſo while it was yet turned into a ſerpent, it skilleth not to diſpute: the Miracle was the greater, if it did ſo after it was turned into a rod again. For there was the form of a miracle confounding the form: but here was the very matter of a miracle deſtroying the very matter of an impoſtor. But what ſay you, if their rods were as phantaſtical and preſtigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as their ſerpents were: and therefore the rather diſpelled even by a ſubſtantial rod? 4. True miracles ſerve to confirm
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:46899:106"/>the truth: but to what end ſerved thoſe falſe mirables of the Magicians, but to <hi>roborate</hi> or <hi>harden Pharoahs heart,</hi> both againſt Gods meſſage and the true miracles? <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.5. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that of the <hi>Frogs (chap.</hi> 8 <hi>v</hi> 7.) Why did not <hi>Phaaoh.</hi> command his Magicians, to take away their Frogs? Was it not becauſe theirs were only preſtigious ſpectres, and could of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend no more but the ſight; and not infeſt the other (and leſſe deluſive) ſenſes; as the other did? And why calls he for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to <hi>intreate</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> to take away the <hi>Frogs</hi> from him: but becauſe they that were of his ſending, were the real Frogs; and thoſe that really plagued him? <hi>v</hi> 8.6. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did God cauſe them to fail in counterfeiting the leaſt things (<hi>the Lice v.</hi> 18.) but that he would thus convince them by the leaſt things, that their greateſt were but counterfeits? And while they confeſſe, <hi>this is the finger of God,</hi> v. 19. Do they not as good as confeſſe, that each of theirs was the finger of <hi>Beelzebub.</hi> 7. When the <hi>Magicians</hi> were ſmitten with <hi>boyls</hi> and <hi>blains,</hi> ſo that <hi>they could not ſtand before Moſes,</hi> ch. 9.11. Why did they not conjure up all their Art and force, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Moſes</hi> again: if that they had been able to do any thing really as <hi>Moſes</hi> did? 8. How ſtands the compariſon of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks <hi>reſiſting</hi> the <hi>truth;</hi> like as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes:</hi> 2 Tim 3.8. But that theſe did it by fallacies, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of ſpiritual truth: as they did it by phantaſmes, or appearances of corporeal truth? Many Philoſophical reaſons might be added: but theſe (ſo clear from the Text) are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove them impoſtors. What may we then judge of the later <hi>Gipſies:</hi> ſince it it was no otherwiſe with their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, theſe <hi>Aegyptians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. Whether the gift of working miracles be not now ceas't? Miracles were never but extraordinary, and temporary. Their very gift not perpetual: and ſimply no ſaving Grace: but might inſtrumentally be acted even by reprobates, as well as by the elect. Having no principles of working habitually remaining in the Soul. Were intended onely to be certain ſignes, upno great occaſions, and preſent helps, in the defect of ordinary means. Needful in the beginning of the Church; to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then weak Faith. They have had their main end already (the ſufficient confirmation of the truth) and the end accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:46899:107"/>that which was deſtinated to the end, might well ceaſe. <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not onely the moſt eminent in miracles; but in him they had their perfection, and completion. His <hi>Diſciples</hi> believed in him, before ever they ſaw him do a miracle: how much more then may his Church, without them; that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the memory of them, hath the ordinances and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means? The permanency of miracles would but have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed the efficacy of Faith: becauſe it would have been an occaſion not to have believed without them. The truth of the Goſpel would ſtill be called in queſtion, and thought du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious and uncertain; if it always needed ſuch confirmation. The promiſes and faith would thus be evacuated: becauſe the walking would be, not by Faith, but by ſight. There would be no end of ſeeking after ſenſible fignes and means; and ſo prophane men would ſtill be tempting unto them; and weak Chriſtians would be diſcouraged in their defect. Not onely ordinary graces would ſo grow vile; but even miracles themſelves: for they would be thought no miracles, by being ſo commonly obvious, and aſſiduous. What need we to ſtand upon ſuch, when the greateſt work of God, and moſt profitable for man, is not alwayes the greateſt miracle? Have we not perpetually Gods ſpiritual miracles, in our voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, converſion, juſtification, regeneration, ſanctification, &amp;c.? And his ordinary miracles, in our creation, propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſervation, &amp;c.? And what need we more? To conclude, was there no other cauſe, our ſinnes are ſufficient to make divine miracles to ceaſe: ſhall we then look after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical miracles, ſignes, and wonders; ſuch as are ſet up by the ſins of men.</p>

               <p>IS not the rarity of miracles (already proved) enough to prove the ſtories of Magical Mirables to be but meer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles? We need not therefore their pardon to call them ſo: nay, they ought to gratifie us that we call them not worſe then ſo. Seeing the vertue of miracles and miraculous operation, is in Gods word alone: and neither in Nature, nor Art, nor Artifice. What can we ſay leſſe, then that all ſuch natural Mirables, are onely for meere naturals to admire? Whoſe Authors have been ſome of them ſpurious; moſt of them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure; all of them (in that particular) vain and nugacious. Who take up their authorities by tradition; from paganiſh ſtory, poetical fiction, and my thological relation, of ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, as were never in Nature, or the world. Who uſe to cite their mirables with ſuch a <hi>(they ſay)</hi> as if they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not onely aſhamed to own them; but afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them. Who ſtuffe up their legendary ſtories of magical mirables, with tales of ſuch ſtrange things, and they ſo incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible; and under ſtrange Names, and they ſo unknown; and in ſuch ſtrange places, and they ſo remote: as that they are not worth ſeeking after; or if they were, yet neither name, nor thing, nor place is to be found. Who urge us one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with this; that ſuch their wonders are not to be proved by reaſon, but referred to experiment: and yet we are as far from ſeeing the one; as from hearing the other. Nevertheleſſe, all theſe are impudently urged, and impoſing upon our Faith, to admit, and admire, what wonderful effects of configurations conſtellations, influences, impreſſions, ſeales, characters; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Elements, Minerals, Stones, Vegetables, Animals; yea and Rationals not excepted. Nay and a many of theſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as tending effectually to Prophecy, Divination, Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:46899:108"/>Prognoſtication. And therefore omitting the ridiculous rabble of magical mirabilaries (for I have neither liſt nor lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to meddle with them at large) I ſhall onely inſtance in a few of them, which they not onely report confidently; but impudently preſcribe to this very purpoſe. Adviſing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the way, that (for all this) they cannot be believed without ſuperſtition, nor practiſed, without ſorcery.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is an herb among the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> called <hi>Ireos;</hi> among the <hi>Greeks, Mutuchiol;</hi> among the <hi>Latins Elitropia:</hi> this herb is of ſo admirable vertue, that if it be gathered in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> while the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Leo,</hi> and wrapt in a <hi>Lawrel</hi> leaf, adding thereunto the <hi>Tooth</hi> of a <hi>Wolf;</hi> and ſo at <hi>night</hi> laid under a mans <hi>head:</hi> if any thing be ſtoln from him, he ſhall ſee the Thiefe, and all his conditions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The herb called by the <hi>Chaldeans Aquilaris,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks Valis,</hi> by the <hi>Latines Chelidonia;</hi> if it be taken with the <hi>heart</hi> of a <hi>Mole,</hi> and be laid upon the <hi>head</hi> of a <hi>ſick</hi> man; it may ſo be diſcerned, or divined, whether he ſhall dye of that diſeaſe, or recover ye or no: for if he now <hi>ſing out,</hi> it is a ſigne he ſhall <hi>die;</hi> but if he <hi>weep,</hi> then ſhall he not dye at that time.

They ſay alſo, that a <hi>Tyke</hi> if it be pulled out of the left ear of a <hi>Dog,</hi> and if it be altogether black; hath great vertue in the <hi>Prognoſtick</hi> of life. For if the ſick party ſhall anſwer him that brought it in, who ſtandeth at his feet, and ſhall ask of him concerning his diſeaſe, there is certain hope of life: and that he ſhall dye, if he make no anſwer.</p>

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:46899:109"/>and dry, as is a <hi>melancholy</hi> humour, hath its influence upon it, increaſeth, and preſerveth it.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The <hi>Rabbines</hi> ſay, there is an Animal called <hi>Jedua,</hi> having a humane ſhape, in the middle of whoſe Navel comes forth a ſtring, by which it is faſtned to the ground like a Gourd, and as far as the length of that ſtring reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it devoures all that is greene about it: and deceiving the ſight, cannot be taken, unleſſe that ſtring be cut off with the ſtroke of a dart, which being cut off, it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dyes. Now the bones of this Animal, being after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manner laid upon the mouth; preſently he whoſe mouth they are laid upon, is taken with a frenzie, and ſoothſaying.</p>
               <p>Now, what a rare Mirable of Art is Magical Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yea and Aſtrological Prediction: that hath all theſe, and many more (if one would take the paines to collect them) Mirables of Nature, peculiarly ſubſerving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? I ſay even Aſtrological Prediction. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtellated fabrication, or confection; all theſe preſaging Mirables (and the like) ſignifie nothing in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And therefore (for the manner of acting in, and by ſuch as theſe) they caution ſtraitly to obſerve the Planet, benevolous, or malevolous; as they wolud preſage upon the effect, good, or ill. And not onely ſo, but the dominion of the Planet, and the day of that domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and the houre of that day: as they would have the predicted effect to be now, or then. So that, to what end ſerve the feigned Mirables of Nature, but to feigne the Mag-aſtro-mantick Art for the greateſt Mirable?</p>

               <p n="2">2. If thou deſireſt to receive vertue from any part of the world, or from any <hi>ſtar,</hi> thou ſhalt (thoſe things being uſed which belong to this <hi>ſtar</hi>) come under its peculiar influence, &amp;c.— When thou doſt to any one <hi>ſpecies</hi> of things, or <hi>individuall,</hi> rightly apply many things, which are things of the ſame ſubject ſcattered among themſelves, conformable to the ſame <hi>Idea,</hi> and <hi>ſtar;</hi> preſently by this matter ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely fitted, a ſingular gift is infuſed by the <hi>Idea,</hi> by meanes of the <hi>ſoul</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> I ſay opportunely fitted, <hi>viz.</hi> under a <hi>harmony,</hi> like to the harmony which did infuſe a certaine ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue into the matter— The celeſtiall harmony produceth that into act, which before was onely in power, when things are rightly expoſed to it in a celeſtiall ſeaſon. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if thou doſt deſire to attract vertue from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:46899:110"/>ſeeke thoſe things that are <hi>ſolary</hi> amongſt vegetables, plants, metals, ſtones, and animals; theſe things are to be uſed, and taken chiefely, which in a ſolary order are higher. For theſe are more availeable; ſo ſhalt thou draw a ſingular gift from the <hi>Sun</hi> through the beames thereof, being ſeaſonably received together, and through the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By artificiall mixtions of things, ſuch as agree with the heavens under a certaine conſtellation, deſcends a vertue, by a certaine likeneſſe and aptneſſe that is in things amongſt themſelves towards their ſuperiours.— So from a certaine compoſition of herbes, vapours, and ſuch like, made according to naturall Philoſophy, and Aſtronomy, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults a certaine common forme, endowed with many gifts of the ſtars.— When therefore any one makes a mixture of many matters, under the coeleſtiall influences; then the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of coeleſtiall actions on one hand, and of naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on the other hand, being joyned together, doth indeed cauſe wonderfull things, by <hi>oyntments,</hi> by <hi>collyries,</hi> by <hi>fumes,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Then the vertues of things do then become wonderfull, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are put to matters that are mixed, and prepa. red in fit ſeaſons, to make them alive, by procuring <hi>life</hi> for them from the <hi>ſtars,</hi> as alſo a <hi>ſenſible ſoule,</hi> as a more noble forme.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Magicians</hi> teach that coeleſtiall gifts may through infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, being conformable to ſuperiours, be drawne down by opportune influences of the heaven: and ſo alſo by theſe coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall, the coeleſtiall <hi>Angels,</hi> as they are ſervants of the <hi>ſtars,</hi> may be procured and conveyed to us.— That not onely <hi>coeleſtiall,</hi> and <hi>vital;</hi> but alſo certaine <hi>intellectuall, angelicall,</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> gifts, may be received from above, by ſome certain matters, having a naturall power of <hi>divinity (ideſt)</hi> which have a naturall correſpondency with the <hi>ſuperiours,</hi> being rightly received and opportunely gathered together, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of naturall Philoſophy, and Aſtronomy. — That an <hi>Image</hi> rightly made of certain proper things, appropriated to any one certain <hi>Angell,</hi> will preſently be ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by that <hi>Angel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. A <hi>Magician</hi> doth make uſe of things manifeſt, to draw
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:46899:111"/>forth things that are occult, <hi>viz.</hi> through the <hi>voyce</hi> of the <hi>ſtars,</hi> through <hi>fumes lights ſounds,</hi> and naturall things, which are agreeable to coeleſſtiall: in which, beſides corporall qualities, there is a kinde of reaſon, ſenſe, and harmony, and incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and divine meaſures, and orders.</p>
               <p n="7">7. No man is ignorant, that ſuperceleſtiall Angels, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may be gained by us through good workes, a pure minde, pureſt prayer, devout humiliation, and the like. Let no man therefore doubt, that in like manner, by ſome certaine <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>Gods</hi> of the <hi>world</hi> may be raiſed by us; or at leaſt the <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi> or <hi>ſervants</hi> of theſe <hi>Gods.</hi>—So we read that the ancient <hi>Prieſts</hi> made <hi>Statues</hi> and <hi>Images,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling things to come, and infuſed into them the <hi>ſpirits</hi> of the <hi>ſtars,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Some <hi>ſuffumigations,</hi> or perfumings that are proper to the <hi>stars,</hi> are of great force for the opportune receiving of coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall gifts, under the rayes of the ſtars; in as much as they do ſtrongly worke upon the aire, and breath.—Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>ſuffumigations</hi> are wont to be uſed to them, that are about to <hi>ſouthſay,</hi> for to affect their fancy; which indeed being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to any certain <hi>Deities,</hi> do fit us to receive divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.— The moſt powerfull <hi>fume</hi> is that which is compounded of the ſeven <hi>Aromaticks,</hi> according to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the ſeven <hi>Planets.</hi>— Know alſo, that according to the opinion of the <hi>Magicians,</hi> in every good matter, as love, good will, and the like, there muſt be a good <hi>fume,</hi> odorife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and pretious: and in every evill matter, as hatred, anger, miſery, and the like, there muſt be a ſtinking <hi>fume,</hi> that is of no worth.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By certain <hi>Alligations</hi> of certain things, as alſo, <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,</hi> or by ſimple <hi>contract,</hi> or the continuation of any thread, we may be able to receive ſome vertues thereby. It is neceſſary that we know the certain rule of <hi>Alligation</hi> and <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion,</hi> and the manner which the <hi>Art</hi> requires, <hi>viz.</hi> that they be done under a certain and ſutable <hi>Conſtellation,</hi> and that they be done with <hi>wyer,</hi> or <hi>ſilken threads, bair,</hi> or <hi>ſinewes</hi> of certain <hi>animals,</hi> or fine cloaths, and the like, according to the ſutableneſs of things.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Rings</hi> alſo, which were alwaies much eſteemed of by
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:46899:111"/>the Antients, when they were opportunely made, do in like manner impreſſe their vertue upon us, &amp;c.—Now the manner of making theſe kind of <hi>Rings,</hi> is this; <hi>viz.</hi> When any <hi>ſtar</hi> aſcends fortunately, with the fortunate aſpect or conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Moon,</hi> we muſt take a <hi>ſtone,</hi> and <hi>herb</hi> that is under that ſtar, and make a <hi>Ring</hi> of the mettal that is ſutable to this ſtar, and in it faſten the ſtone, putting the herb or root under it: not omitting the inſcriptions of <hi>Images, Names,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> as alſo the proper <hi>Suffumigations,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The <hi>countenance, geſture,</hi> the motion, ſetting, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the body, being accidental to us, conduce to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the coeleſtial gifts; and expoſe us to the ſuperior bodies, and produce certain effects in us.—Whoſoever therefore doth the more exactly imitate the coeleſtial bodies, either in nature, ſtudy, actions, motion, geſture, countenance, paſſions of the minde, and opportunity of the ſeaſon; is ſo much the more like to the heavenly bodies, and can receive larger gifts from them.</p>
               <p n="12">12. It conduceth very much for the receiving the benefit of the heavens, in any work; if we ſhall by the Heaven make our ſelves ſutable to it, in our thoughts, affections, imaginations, elections, deliberations, contemplations, and the like. For ſuch like paſſions do vehemently ſtir up our ſpirit to their likeneſſe, and ſuddainly expoſe us, and ours, to the ſuperiour <hi>ſignificators</hi> of ſuch like paſſions; and alſo by reaſon of their dignity, and neerneſſe to the ſuperiours, do much more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the coeleſtials, then any material things. For our minde can through imaginations, or reaſon by a kinde of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, be ſo conformed to any ſtar, as ſuddainly to be filled with the vertues of that ſtar; as if it were a proper recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of the influence thereof.—We muſt therefore in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very work, and application of things, affect vehemently, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, hope, and believe ſtrongly; for that will be a great help — Therefore he that works in <hi>Magick,</hi> muſt be of a <hi>conſtant belief,</hi> be credulous, and not doubt at all of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the effect.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The <hi>Arabians</hi> ſay, that mans <hi>minde,</hi> when it is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon any work, through its paſſion, and effects, is joyned with the mind of the <hi>ſtars,</hi> and <hi>intelligences:</hi> and being ſo
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:46899:112"/>joyned, is the cauſe that ſome wonderful vertue be infuſed into our works, and things. — And according to this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed the Art of Characters, Images, Inchantments, and ſome ſpeeches, and many other wonderful experiments to every thing which the minde affects. — For all thoſe things which the minde acts, and dictates by characters, figures, words, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, geſtures, and the like, help the appetite of the ſoul, and acquire certain wonderful vertues, as from the ſoul of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator, in that hour when ſuch a like appetite doth invade it: ſo from the opportunity, and coeleſtial influence, moving the mind in that manner. — And it is a general rule in them, that every minde that is more excellent in its deſire, and affections, makes ſuch like things more fit for it ſelf; as alſo more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to that which it deſires. Every one therefore that is willing to work in <hi>Magick,</hi> muſt know the vertue, meaſure, order, and degree of his own ſoul, in the power of the univerſe</p>
               <p n="14">14. Thoſe <hi>words</hi> are of greater efficacy then other, which repreſent greater things, as intellectual, coeleſtial, ſupernatural; as more expreſly, ſo more myſteriouſly. Alſo thoſe that come from a more worthy tongue, or from any of a more holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: for theſe, as it were, certain ſignes, and repreſentations, receive a power of coeleſtial, and ſupercoeleſtial things, as from the vertue of things explained, of which they are the <hi>vebieula:</hi> ſo from a power put into them by the vertue of the ſpeaker.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Proper Names</hi> of things are very neceſſary in magical o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations.—Hence Magicians ſay, that <hi>proper Names</hi> of things are certain rayes of things, every where preſent at all times, keeping the power of things, as the eſſence of the thing ſignified rules, and is diſcerned in them, and know the things by them, as by proper, and living images. — According to the properties of the influences, <hi>proper Names,</hi> reſult to things. — Every voyce therefore that is ſignificative, firſt of all ſignifies by the influence of the coeleſtial harmony: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the impoſition of man; although oftentimes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe by this, then by that. But when both ſignifications meet in any voice or name, which are put upon them by the ſaid harmony, or men; then that name is with a double vertue <hi>viz.</hi> Natural, and arbitrary, made moſt efficacious to act; as oft as it ſhall be uttered in due place, and time, and ſeriouſly,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:46899:112"/>with an intention exerciſed upon the matter rightly diſpofed, and that can naturally be acted upon by it.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In compoſing of <hi>verſes,</hi> and <hi>orations,</hi> for the attracting the vertue of any <hi>ſtar</hi> or <hi>Deity;</hi> you muſt diligently conſider what vertues any ſtar containes; as alſo what effects and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations; and to infer them in <hi>verſes,</hi> by prayſing, extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling amplifying, and ſetting forth thoſe things, which ſuch a kind of ſtar is wont to cauſe by way of its influence: and by vilifying, and diſpraiſing thoſe things which it is wont to deſtroy, and hinder. And by ſupplicating and begging for that, which we deſire to get: and by condemning, and deteſting that, which we would have deſtroyed and hindred. And after the ſame manner, he make an elegant <hi>oration,</hi> and duely diſtinct by <hi>Articles,</hi> with competent numbers, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Moreover <hi>Magicians</hi> command that we call upon, and <hi>pray</hi> by the names of the ſame ſtar, or name to them to whom ſuch a verſe belongs; by their wonderfull things, or miracles, by their courſes, and waies in their ſphere; by their light, by the dignity of their kingdome; by the beauty and brightneſs that is in it; by their ſtrong, and powerfull vertues; and by ſuch like as theſe.— Beſides, with the divers ſorts of the names of the ſtars, they command us to call upon them, by the names of the <hi>Intelligences,</hi> ruling over the ſtarres them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Magicians</hi> command, that in every worke, there be <hi>imprecations,</hi> and <hi>inſcriptions</hi> made, by which the Operator may expreſſe his affection: That if hee gather an <hi>herbe,</hi> or a <hi>ſtone,</hi> he declare for what uſe he doth it; if he make a <hi>picture,</hi> he ſay, and write to what end he maketh it.</p>
               <p n="19">19. When thou art working any thing which belongs to any <hi>planet,</hi> thou muſt place it in its Dignities, fortunate, and powerfull, and ruling in the day, houre, and in the figure of the Heaven. Neither ſhalt thou expect the ſignification of the worke to be powerfull; but alſo thou muſt obſerve the <hi>Moon</hi> opportunely directed to this; for thou ſhalt doe nothing without the aſſiſtance of the <hi>Moon.</hi> And if thou haſt more patternes of thy work, obſerve them all, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Thou ſhalt obſerve that the <hi>Angles</hi> of the <hi>Aſcendant</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:46899:113"/>and a <hi>tenth</hi> and <hi>Seventh</hi> be fortunate; as alſo the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Aſcendent,</hi> and place of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moon;</hi> and the place of part of the <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the <hi>Lord</hi> thereof; and the <hi>Lord</hi> of the foregoing conjunction, and prevention, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Magicians</hi> adviſe us, that in caſting, or in graving <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,</hi> we would write upon it the name of the effect; and this upon the <hi>back,</hi> when evill, as deſtruction; on the <hi>belly,</hi> when good, as love. Moreover in the forehead of the <hi>Image</hi> let be written the name of the <hi>ſpecies,</hi> or <hi>individuum,</hi> which the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> repreſents; or for whom, or againſt whom it is made. Alſo on the <hi>breaſt</hi> let the name of the <hi>ſigne,</hi> or <hi>face</hi> aſcending, and the <hi>Lord</hi> thereof be written; alſo the names and charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of its <hi>Angles.</hi> Moreover in making the <hi>Image,</hi> they adviſe that <hi>prayer,</hi> for the effect for which it is made, bee uſed.— Now they uſe the <hi>Images</hi> being made diverſly, according to the vertues thereof. Sometimes they hang them, or bind them to the body; ſometimes they bury them under the earth, or a River; ſometimes they hang them in a chimney over the ſmoak; or upon a tree, that they may be moved by the wind; ſometimes with the head upward, and ſometimes downward; ſometimes they put them into hot water, or into the ſire. For they ſay, as the workers of the <hi>Images</hi> do affect the <hi>Image</hi> it ſelfe; ſo doth it bring the like paſſions upon thoſe to whom it was aſcribed, as the mind of the Operator hath dictated it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. To make one fortunate we make an image, in which theſe are fortunate; <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>ſignificator</hi> of the life thereof, the <hi>givers</hi> of the life, the <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>planets.</hi> Moreover to the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> the middle of the heaven, and the <hi>Lords</hi> thereof, be fortunate: alſo the place of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and place of the <hi>Moon,</hi> part of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and <hi>Lord</hi> of conjunction, or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made before their nativity, by depreſſing the <hi>malignant</hi> planets. But if we will make an <hi>Image</hi> to procure miſery we muſt doe contrarywiſe; and thoſe which wee place here fortunate, muſt there be infortunate, by raiſing malignant ſtars.— Alſo for the deſtroying or prejudicing any, let there be made an <hi>Image</hi> under the <hi>aſcenſion</hi> of that man, whom thou wouldſt deſtroy, and prejudice; and thou ſhalt make unfortunate the <hi>Lord</hi> of the <hi>Houſe</hi> of his life, the <hi>Lord</hi>

               <p n="23">23 The <hi>youth</hi> to be initiated to <hi>Diaination</hi> by <hi>magick ſpells,</hi> ought to be choſen, ſound, without ſickneſſe, ingenious comely, perfect in his members, of a quick ſpirit, eloquent in ſpeech; that in him the divine power might be converſant, as in the good <hi>houſes:</hi> that the minde of the youth having quickly attained ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, may be reſtored to its divinity. — If therefore thou ſhalt be a man perfect in the ſound underſtanding of <hi>Religion</hi> and piouſly, and moſt conſtantly meditateſt on it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubting believeſt; and art ſuch an one on whom the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of holy <hi>Rites,</hi> and Nature hath conferred dignity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, and one whom the divine powers contemn not; thou ſhalt be able by praying, conſecrating, ſacrificing, invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to attract ſpiritual, and coeleſtial Poems; and to imprint them on thoſe things thou pleaſeſt; and by it to vivifie every magical work.</p>
               <p n="24">24.

To work Miracles by divine <hi>names, words, ſeales, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters;</hi> all muſt be done in moſt pure <hi>gold,</hi> or <hi>virgin parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> pure, clean, and unſpotted; alſo with <hi>Inke</hi> made for this purpoſe of the <hi>ſmoak</hi> of <hi>conſecrated waxe lights,</hi> or <hi>incenſe,</hi> and <hi>holy water.</hi> The <hi>actor</hi> alſo muſt be <hi>purifyed</hi> and cleanſed by <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> and have an infallible <hi>hope,</hi> a conſtant <hi>Faith,</hi> and his minde lifted up to the <hi>moſt high God,</hi> if he would ſurely obtain this divine power.</p>
               <p n="26">26. There are four kinds of divine <hi>phrenzy</hi> proceeding from
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:46899:114"/>ſeveral <hi>Deities;</hi> viz. from the <hi>Muſes,</hi> from <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> from <hi>Apollo,</hi> and from <hi>Venus.</hi> The firſt phrenzy therefore proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the <hi>Muſes,</hi> ſtirs up, and tempers the minde, and makes it divine, by drawing ſuperiour things to inferiour things, by things natural. Of which there are <hi>nine</hi> degrees, &amp;c.— The ſecond phrenzie proceeds from <hi>Dionyſius;</hi> this doth by <hi>expiations</hi> exteriour, and interiour, and by <hi>conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,</hi> by myſteries, by <hi>ſolemnities, rites, temples,</hi> and <hi>obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> divert the ſoul into the minde, the ſupreme part of it ſelf, and makes it a fit and pure temple of the Gods, in which the divine ſpirits may dwell, which the ſoul then poſſeſſing as the aſſociate of life, is filled by them with felicity, wiſdome and oracles; not in ſignes, and marks, and in conjectures; but in a certain concitation of the minde, and free motion, &amp;c.— The third kinde of phrenzy proceeds from <hi>Apollo,</hi> viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From the minde of the world: this doth by certain ſacred myſteries, vowes, ſacrifices, adorations, invocations, and certain ſacred Arts, or certain ſecret confections; by which the ſpirit of their God did infuſe vertue, make the ſoul riſe above the minde, by joyning it with <hi>Deities,</hi> and <hi>Daemons,</hi> &amp;c.—The fourth kind of phrenzie proceeds from <hi>Venus;</hi> and it doth by a fervent love, convert and tranſ-unite the minde to God, and makes it altogether like to God, as it were the proper image of God. — The ſoul therefore being converted and made like to God, is ſo formed of God, that it doth above all intellect, know all things by a certain eſſential contract of divinity. — Doth, beſides that it hath by its integrity obtained the ſpirit of prophecy, ſometimes work wonderful things, and greater then the nature of the world can do, which works are called Miracles.</p>
               <p n="27">27. It was a cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Ancients,</hi> that they who ſhould receive <hi>Anſwers,</hi> certain expiations and ſacrifices being firſt celebrated, and divine worſhip ended, did religiouſly lye down, even in a conſecrated chamber, or at leaſt on the ſhrines of ſacrifices, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Whoſoever would receive divine <hi>Dreams;</hi> let him be well diſpoſed in <hi>body,</hi> his <hi>brain</hi> free from <hi>vapours,</hi> and his <hi>mind</hi> from <hi>perturbations;</hi> and let him that day abſtain from <hi>ſupper,</hi> neither let him drink that which will <hi>inebriate;</hi> let him have
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:46899:114"/>a clean and neat <hi>chamber,</hi> alſo <hi>exorcized,</hi> or conſecrated; in the which a <hi>perfume</hi> being made, his <hi>temples</hi> annointed, things cauſing dreams being put on his <hi>fingers,</hi> and the repreſentation of the <hi>heavens</hi> being put under his <hi>head;</hi> and <hi>paper</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated, his <hi>Prayers</hi> being ſaid; let him go to bed, earneſtly <hi>meditating</hi> on that thing which he deſireth to know: ſo ſhall he ſee moſt true and certain dreams, with the true illumination of his intellect, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Every one that works by <hi>Lots,</hi> muſt go about it with a minde well diſpoſed, not troubled, not diſtracted, and with a ſtrong deſire, firm deliberation, and conſtant intention of knowing that which ſhall be deſired. Moreover he muſt, being qualified with purity, chaſtity, and holineſſe towards <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>coeleſtials,</hi> with an undoubted <hi>hope,</hi> firm <hi>faith,</hi> and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Orations,</hi> invocate them; that he may be made worthy of receiving the divine ſpirits, and knowing the divine pleaſure. For if thou ſhalt be qualified, they will diſcover to thee moſt great ſecrets by vertue of <hi>Lots:</hi> and thou ſhalt become a true Prophet, and able to ſpeak truth concerning things paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come, of which thou ſhalt be demanded.</p>
               <p n="30">30. Whoſoever being deſirous to come to the ſupreme ſtate of the ſoul, goeth to receive <hi>Oracles;</hi> muſt go to them being chaſtely and devoutly diſpoſed, being pure and clean to go to them; ſo that his ſoul be polluted with no filthineſſe, and free from all guilt. He muſt alſo ſo purifie his Minde, and Body, as much as he may, from all diſeaſes, and paſſions, and all irrational conditions; which adhere to it as ruſt to iron, by rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, and diſpoſing thoſe things, which belong to the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the minde; for by this means he ſhall receive the truer, and more efficacious <hi>Oracles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31 We muſt therefore firſt obſerve cleanneſs in <hi>food,</hi> in <hi>works,</hi> in <hi>affections;</hi> and to put away all filthineſſe, and perturbations of the minde, and whatſoever ſenſe, or ſpirit, that offends, and whatſoever things are in the mind unlike to the <hi>heavens;</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if they be in minde and ſpirit, but alſo if they be in the body, or about the body: for ſuch an external cleanneſſe is believed not to help a little to the purity of the minde, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="32">32 They that deſire to have this ſpirit pure, and potent; let them uſe <hi>dryer meats,</hi> and extenuate this groſſe body with <hi>faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:46899:115"/>and they make it eaſily penetrable; and leſt by the weight thereof, the ſpirit ſhould either become thick, or be ſuffocated; let them preſerve the body clean by <hi>Lotions, Frictions, exerciſes,</hi> and <hi>cloathings;</hi> and corroborate their ſpirits by <hi>lights,</hi> and <hi>fumes;</hi> and bring it to be a pure and thin fineneſſe.</p>
               <p n="33">33. We muſt acquit and avert our mindes from all <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,</hi> and ſuch like paſſions, that we may attain to the ſimple truth? which indeed many Philoſophers are ſaid to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to in the <hi>ſolitude</hi> of a long time. For the minde by ſolitude, being looſed from all care of humane affairs, is at leaſure, and prepared to receive the gifts of the coeleſtial dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="34">34. It is believed, and it is delivered by them that are skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſacred things, that the minde alſo may be expiated with certain <hi>inſtitutions,</hi> and <hi>ſacraments</hi> miniſtred outwardly, as by <hi>Sacrifices, Baptiſms,</hi> and <hi>Adjurations, Benedictions, Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſprinklings of <hi>Holy water,</hi> by <hi>annointings,</hi> and <hi>fumes;</hi> not ſo much conſecrated to this, as having a natural power thus to do.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Moreover, the <hi>Magicians</hi> when they made any <hi>confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> either natural, or artificial, belonging to any ſtar; this did they afterward religiouſly <hi>offer</hi> and <hi>ſacrifice</hi> to the ſame ſtar: receiving not ſo much a natural vertue from the influence thereof, being opportunely received, as by that religious <hi>obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> receiving it divinely confirmed, and ſtronger, &amp;c. — Moreover to the coeleſtial and aetherical Gods <hi>white ſacrifices</hi> were offered: but to the terreſtrial, or infernal, <hi>black</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="36">36. Moreover, we muſt petition for, and to the effectors of the thing deſired; <hi>viz.</hi> Such an <hi>Angel, Star,</hi> or <hi>Heror,</hi> on whom the office lies: but obſerving that our invocation on them muſt be made with due number, weight, and meaſure; and according to the rules delivered concerning inchantments.</p>
               <p n="37">37. <hi>Conſecration</hi> is a lifting up of experiments, by which a ſpiritual ſoul, being drawn by proportion and conformity, is infuſed into the matter of our works, according to the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Magical Art</hi> rightly and lawfully prepared, and our work is vivified by the ſpirit of underſtanding.—So in the <hi>conſecration</hi> of <hi>water, fire, oyle, places, paper,</hi> ſwords, &amp;c. Let there be <hi>commemoration</hi> made, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="235" facs="tcp:46899:115"/>
               <p n="38">38. Whoſoever therefore thou art, who deſireſt to operate in <hi>this faculty,</hi> in the firſt place implore <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> being one; that thou alſo maieſt be one worthy of his favour: bee cleane within and without, in a cleane place. — Waſh your ſelves oft, and at the daies appointed, according to the myſteries of number, put on cleane cloaths, and abſtaine from all uncleanneſſe, pollution, and luſt.— Be not thou coupled to a polluted or menſtruous woman, neither to her who hath the Hemachoides, touch not an uncleane thing, nor a carkaſe.— Thou ſhalt waſh, and annoint, and perfume thy ſelfe, and ſhalt offer ſacrifices.— Further, perfumes, ſacrifice and unction penetrate all things, and open the gates of the elements, and of the heavens, that through them a man may ſee the ſecrets of God; heavenly things, and thoſe things which are above the heavens, and alſo thoſe which deſcend from the heavens, as Angels and Spirits of deep pits, and profound places, apparitions of deſert places, and doth make them to come to you, to appeare viſibly, and obey you.</p>
               <p n="39">39. Moreover, whatſoever thou operateſt, do it with an earneſt affection, and hearty deſire; that the goodneſſe of the heavens, and heavenly bodies may favour thee; whoſe favour that thou mayeſt the more eaſily obtaine; the fitneſſe of the place, time, profeſſion, or cuſtome, diet, habit, exerciſe, and name alſo do wonderfully conduce: for by theſe the power of nature is not onely changed, but alſo overcome. For a <hi>fortunate place</hi> conduceth much to favour.— What place is congruous to each one, muſt be found out by his nativity, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="40">40. Make election alſo of <hi>houres</hi> &amp; <hi>daies</hi> for thy operations. For not without cauſe <hi>our Saviour</hi> ſpake, <hi>Are there not twelve houres in the day,</hi> and ſo forth? For the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> teach, that <hi>times</hi> can give a certaine <hi>fortune</hi> to our buſineſſes. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> likewiſe have obſerved; and to conclude, all the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent verſe men conſent in this; that it is of very great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in what <hi>moment</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and diſpoſition of the heavens, every thing whether naturall, or artificiall, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its being in this world: for they have delivered, that the firſt <hi>moment</hi> hath ſo great power, that all the courſe of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:46899:116"/>
                  <hi>fortune</hi> dependeth thereon; and may be foretold thereby.</p>
               <p>All theſe are not aſhamed to ſhew themſelves in Engliſh, ere this. I have onely now collected them here, and there (with a running hand) to the intent, that (at one view) it might be diſcerned; at leaſt (by compariſon) examined; whether theſe dignifications, qualifications, diſpoſitions, preparations of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> be not onely ſo ſuperſtitious; as of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> be not onely ſo ſuperſtitious; as for conſcience, and religion, to abhor them: but ſo ridiculous as for reaſon, and ſenſe to deride them? And whether theſe their preparations, be not meer pollutions in themſelves; and theſe their dignifications very viliſications, to natural, and moral men: and theſe their conſecrations, be not utter abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to God, and all good men? Nay, and whether the moſt damnable witches, have not been initiated, by ſuch kind of preparative ſolemnities: and their moſt execrable witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts operated, by ſuch effectual ceremonies, as theſe; yea and they more fair ſeeming, then the faireſt of them?</p>

               <p>Beſides all theſe (and infinite ſuch like) ſpeculative interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, as touching auſpicating elections (common both to preſcribers and conſulters) there are, together with theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellations, certain practical configurations: as the fabricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Images, ſtatues, pictures, <hi>Taliſmanus,</hi> idols (painted, molten, graven) under certain ſydereal conjunctions; for the repelling of things hurtful from you; and procuring of things helpful to you, <hi>viz.</hi> If you would drive away any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous ſerpent, or noyſom beaſt; make the figure thereof in ſome certain matter, under ſome convenient conſtellation, and inſcribe thereupon the name of the ſigne aſcending, and the name of the thing you would expell, &amp;c. And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect, do it after a contrary conſtellation, &amp;c. And obſerve the like, in alluring to love; or in provoking to hatred; in curing of diſeaſes, and procuring of health, &amp;c. But by no means (ſo conſcientious, or cautious they are) aſcribe the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to the Image; for that's (ſay they) idolatry, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, witchcraft: but to the conſtellation: and I pray, what's that? But I am weary with reckoning up (in part) things of ſo great folly; and of greater impiety. Onely I ask (not them, but the ſound, and ſober) if indeed they be not ſo? I mean, if the buſineſſe, and folly of the world (brought and
<pb facs="tcp:46899:118"/>ſought to be directed by the buſineſſe, and folly of an Art) be not very much repugnant to humane prudence; and to divine providence much more?</p>

               <p>WHether Magicians and Aſtrologers themſelves, have not plainly and plentifully, diſcovered and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, the vanity and impiety of Magick and Aſtrology? And whether it be not an Argument irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable againſt an Art, or operation: whenas the Arch-Artiſts are ſo far convinc't, as to confeſſe the pravity, and obliquity thereof themſelves? For who can more truly and fully ſet them forth, then they that have given themſelves over to ſtudy and practiſe them? How many things (of old, and of late) have been ſpoken (either through a ſpirit of recantation, a conſcience of conviction, or a ſury of exclamation) by magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, againſt Magick; and by Aſtrologers, againſt Aſtrology? Hear what one of them ſaith both againſt himſelf, and all the reſt; of what kind or ſort ſoever.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever things have here already, and ſhall afterward be ſaid by me; I would not have any one <hi>aſſent</hi> to them: nor ſhal I my ſelf any further, then they ſhall be approved of by the <hi>unit verſal Church,</hi> and the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>faithful</hi>—Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and thoſe who were the authors of this Art amongſt the Antients, have been <hi>Chaldeans, Aegyptians, Aſſyrians, Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Arabians;</hi> all whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> was perverſe, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted idolatry. We muſt very much take heed, leſt we ſhould permit their <hi>errors</hi> to war againſt the grounds of the <hi>Catholike Religion:</hi> For this was blaſphemous, and ſubject to the curſe; and I alſo ſhould be a blaſphemer, if I ſhould not admoniſh you of theſe things in this ſcience. Whereſoever therefore you ſhall find theſe things written by us; know that theſe things are
<pb facs="tcp:46899:119"/>onely related out of other Authors, and not put down by us, for truth; but for a probable conjecture, which is allyed to truth; and an inſtruction for imitation in thoſe things that are true.—Of Magick I wrote (whilſt I was very young) three large books, which I called <hi>Of Occult Philoſophie;</hi> in which what was then, through the curioſity of my youth, erroneous, I now being more adviſed, am willing to have retracted, by this <hi>Recantation:</hi> For I have heretofore ſpent very much time and coſt in theſe <hi>vanities.</hi> At length I grew ſo wiſe, as to underſtand how, and by what reaſons I was bound to dehort others from this deſtruction. For whoſoever do not in the truth, nor in the power of God, but in the deluſions of Devils, according to the operation of theevil ſpirits, preſume to <hi>divine,</hi> and <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and by <hi>magical vanilies,</hi> exorciſms, inchantments, love-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, allurements, and other deviliſh works and deceits, of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, exorciſing preſtigious things, and making oſtentation of phantaſms, boaſting themſelves to work miracles, preſently vaniſhing: all theſe, with <hi>Jannes,</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> and <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> ſhall be deſtinated to the torments of eternal fire.</p>
               <p>The antient Philoſophers teach us to know the nature of the <hi>genius</hi> of every man, by ſtars, their influx, and aſpects, which are potent in the <hi>nativity</hi> of any one: but with inſtructions ſo diverſe, and differing amongſt themſelves; that it is much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to underſtand the myſteries of the Heavens by their dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicers</hi> following the <hi>ſtoicks,</hi> affirms that the foreknowing of future things belongs onely to the Gods. And <hi>Ptolomie</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer ſaith, that they onely that are inſpired with a deity, foretel particular things. To them <hi>Peter</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> conſents ſaying, <hi>Propheſying is not made according to the will of man, but holy men ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed that you be not deceived by them that are decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Neither can the great reading of books direct you here, ſince they are but as riddles. How great writings are there made of the irreſiſtible power of <hi>magical Art,</hi> of the <hi>Prodigious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> of the monſtrous tranſmutations of Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, of the <hi>bleſſed ſtone,</hi> by which, <hi>Mydas</hi>-like, all mettals that were touched, were preſently tranſmuted into Gold, or Silver. All which are found vain, fictitious, and falſe, &amp;c.—What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb facs="tcp:46899:119"/>the monſtrous <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> the prodigious <hi>magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> the envious <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> and bewitching <hi>Necremancers</hi> can do by ſpirits.</p>
               <p>See where their Faith is placed, where their hope is repoſed, who endeavour to ſubject the Elements, Heavens, Fate, Nature, Providence, God, and all things, to the command of one <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician:</hi> and ſeek for the preſervation of a kingdom from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> the enemies of publike preſervation; Saying in their heart with <hi>Ochozias,</hi> there is not a God in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> let us go and conſult <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the God of <hi>Achron,</hi> &amp;c.—Are they not delivered over to a reprobate ſenſe, who deſire the certainty of ſecret counſels from the Devil, the father of lies: and hope for victory elſewhere, then from the <hi>Lord of Hoſts?</hi>— All theſe ungodly follies are wont to bring deſtruction to the admirers thereof: to which truly they who eſpecially confide, are made the moſt unfortunate of all men.—Surely it is unknown to theſe <hi>Fools,</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi> of the Devil for to finde out things to come; and to pronounce truth concerning thoſe things which hang over our heads, and are occult, and from heaven portended unto men; and to effect things which exceed the common courſe of Nature, &amp;c.—O Fools, and wicked! Who by theſe Arts would eſtabliſh a kingdom; by which formerly moſt potent Empires have fallen, and have been utterly overthrown.</p>
               <p>It is now time to ſpeak of the <hi>Mathematical diſciplines,</hi> which are reputed to be the moſt certain of all other; and yet they all conſiſt not, but in the opinions of their own <hi>Doctors;</hi> to whom much faith is given; who alſo have erred in them not a little. Which <hi>Alhumaſar</hi> (one of them) atteſts to us, ſaying; that the Antients, even ſince <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> time, have not plainly known the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> For ſeeing all theſe Arts are chiefly converſant about the ſpherical, or round, whether figure, or number, or motion; they are forced at length to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that a perfect round, or ſpherical, is no where to be found neither according to Art, nor according to Nature. And theſe diſciplines, although they have cauſed hereſies in the Church, few, or none; yet (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) they nothing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſalvation; but rather induce to errour, and recall from God: and (as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith) are not ſciences of piety.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46899:120"/>
               <p>This <hi>Arithmetick</hi> (vaine and ſuperſtitious) hath brought forth <hi>Geomancy,</hi> and divination, and cogging, dicing, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and whatſoever is of that ſort of ſortilegious numerals. Although almoſt all doe adopt <hi>Geomancy</hi> to <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the like judiciall way: and becauſe they draw the power thereof not ſo much from number as motion.—Of this there have written among the Antients, <hi>Haly;</hi> among the moderne, <hi>Gerardus Cremonenſis, Bartholomeus Parmenſis,</hi> and one <hi>Tundinus.</hi> I alſo have written a certaine <hi>Geomancy,</hi> farre different from that of others: and yet not leſſe ſuperſtitions, and fallacious; or if you will, let me ſay, not leſſe lying then all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Neither do I think that to be paſſed over which the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks</hi> did aſſert; and which others think that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe believed: <hi>ſc.</hi> that the <hi>elements</hi> of <hi>Letters</hi> doe poſſeſſe their cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>numbers;</hi> out of which they did divine by the proper names of men: the numbers of the letters of every one being collected in ſumme; which compared, they gave to him the palme, whoſe ſumme exceeded the other; whether it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired about warre, or ſtrife, or marriage, or life, or any other the like.—And there are, who by the ſame compute, promiſe themſelves to finde out the <hi>Horoſcopes:</hi> as I know not whom, one <hi>Alchandrius</hi> by name, an obſcure Philoſopher, hath delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning them.</p>
               <p>Moreover I cannot eaſily ſay, what <hi>Pythagoricall</hi> myſteries, what <hi>Magicall</hi> powers, they dream to be in numbers; although divided of things themſelves: yea and dare ſay, that the world could not have been created by God, but by thoſe inſtruments and exemplars: and that the knowledge of all divine things are contained in <hi>numbers,</hi> as in a rule, of all, moſt certaine. Hence aroſe the hereſies of <hi>Marcus,</hi> and <hi>Magus,</hi> and <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> founded on numbers, and proceeding from numbers: who preſumed themſelves able to finde out, and declare divine religion, and innumerable ſecrets of the divine truth, by moſt frigid numbers.—All which are vaine, and feyned, and falſe; neither remaines there any thing of truth to theſe <hi>Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> but an inſenſate and inanimate number: and yet they ſuppoſe themſelves to play the part of a divine, or divining men, becauſe they know how to number</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:46899:120"/>
               <p>The <hi>Astrologie,</hi> which is <hi>Aſtronomie</hi> (or rather the <hi>Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> which is <hi>Aſtrologie</hi>) is wholly fallacious; and much more nugacious then the fables of <hi>Poets,</hi> whoſe Maſters (bold men in truth, and authors of prodigies) out of an impious curioſity, after their owne fancy, and above humane capacity (as if it were <hi>Baſilides</hi> the hereticke his <hi>Abraxas</hi>) fabricate the heavenly orbes; and depaint the meaſures of the ſtarres, their motions, figures, images, numbers, concents; as if they were but of late deſcended downe from heaven, and had been there converſant for ſome time: by which they imagine all things ſtand, are done, and may be knowne. And yet about theſe very things they are greatly diſagreeing among themſelves, and contrary, and repugnant one to another: ſo that I doubt not to ſay with <hi>Pliny,</hi> it plainly argues the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this Art, and that it is none: in that, teaching the very principles of it, one way thinke, or judge the <hi>Indians,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Mores,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Jewes,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Arabians</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Greekes,</hi> otherwiſe the <hi>Latines;</hi> otherwiſe the ancient, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the moderne Authors. For, treating of the number of the Spheres; <hi>Plato, Proclus, Ariſtotle, Averroes,</hi> and almoſt all the Aſtrologers before <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> a few only excepted, doe number <hi>eight Spheres</hi> only; yet <hi>Averroes</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Iſaac</hi> ſay, that <hi>Hermes,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> placed the <hi>new orbe,</hi> or <hi>ninth ſphere.</hi> To which opinion adhere, <hi>Azarcheles</hi> the <hi>More,</hi> and <hi>Tebith,</hi> and the ſame learned <hi>Rabbi, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Alpetragus;</hi> to which aſſent <hi>Albertus</hi> the <hi>Almaine,</hi> of his age (I know not for what famous enterprize of his) called the <hi>Great:</hi> and all they, who approve of the acceſſe and receſſe of motions. But the junior Aſtrologers now ſurmiſe, that there are <hi>ten Orbes;</hi> which <hi>Albertus</hi> himſelfe ſuppoſes <hi>Ptolomie</hi> alſo to have held <hi>Averroes</hi> alſo ſuppoſes him to reckon up <hi>nine;</hi> when as in truth <hi>Ptolomie</hi> affirmes no more but <hi>eight.</hi> But <hi>Alphontius</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time following the judgement of <hi>Rabbi Iſaac,</hi> by ſurname <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zam,</hi> held <hi>nine Spheres:</hi> yet four yeeres after the edition of his Tables, adhering to the opinions of <hi>Albuhaſsen</hi> the <hi>More,</hi> and <hi>Albategni,</hi> he recal'd himſelfe againe to <hi>eight.</hi> Alſo <hi>Rabbi Abraham Avenezra,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Levi,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Abrabam Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutus,</hi> do ſuppoſe there to be no moveable orbe above the eight:
<pb facs="tcp:46899:121"/>and as touching the motion of the eighth Orbe, and of the fixed Stars, they are very various amongſt themſelves. For the Chaldeans and the Aegyptians affirm it to be carried with one motion onely: to whom aſſent <hi>Alpatragus,</hi> and of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Alexander Aquilinus.</hi> But the reſt of the Aſtronomers, from <hi>Hipparchus</hi> to our times, ſay that it is carried about with many motions. The <hi>Talmudiſticall Iewes</hi> aſſigne to it a double motion. <hi>Azarcheles</hi> and <hi>Tebith,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> have aſcribed to it the motion of <hi>Trepidation,</hi> which they ſay is of acceſſe, and receſſe; above the little circles that are about the head of <hi>Aries</hi> and <hi>Libra.</hi> But in this they differ among themſelves: becauſe <hi>Azarcheles</hi> ſaith, the moveable head cannot be diſtant from the fixt, more then ten parts. But <hi>Tebith</hi> ſaith, not more then four parts, with ten, and almoſt nine minuts. <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> ſaith, not more then eight parts: and therefore the fixed Stars not alwaies varying to the ſame parts of the world; but they conceive them ſometime returning where they began. But <hi>Ptolomy, Albategni, Rabbi Levi, Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezra, Zacutus,</hi> and (amongſt the moderne) <hi>Paulue Florentinus,</hi> and <hi>Auguſtinus Ritius</hi> (very familiar to me in <hi>Italy</hi>) affirm the Stars to be moved alwaies and continually, according to the ſucceſſions of ſignes. The latter Aſtronomers attribute a tripple motion to the eighth Sphere; one proper, which we have called that of <hi>Trepidation;</hi> which is compleated once in ſeven thouſand yeeres: another which they call that of <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> from the ninth Sphere, whoſe circumvolution is not finiſhed in leſſe then forty nine thouſand yeeres: the third, from the renth Orbe, which they call the motion of the <hi>Firſt moveable,</hi> or the motion of <hi>Rapture,</hi> or the <hi>Diurnall;</hi> which within a naturall day returns daily to his beginning. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they who attribut a double motion to the eighth Sphere, doe not all of them agree among themſelves: For almoſt all the modern, and they who admit of the motion of <hi>Trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doe argue it to be hurried along in a ſuperiour Sphere: but <hi>Albategni, Albuhaſſen, Alfraganus, Averroes, Rabbi Levi, Abraham Zaeutus, Auguſtinus Ritius,</hi> doe think that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall motion,</hi> which others think to be the motion of <hi>Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> is not proper to any Sphere, but is done by the whole Heavens. And <hi>Averroes</hi> himſelfe ſaith, that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> (in his book
<pb facs="tcp:46899:121"/>which he inſcribed of <hi>narrations</hi>) doth deny the motion of <hi>Gyration.</hi> And <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> ſaith, he thinks with <hi>Averroes,</hi> that the <hi>Diurnall motion</hi> is done by the whole Heavens. Again, they no more agree, about the meaſure of the motion of the eighth Orbe, and of the fixed Stars. For <hi>Ptolomy</hi> thinks that the fixed Stars are moved one degree in an hundred yeers. <hi>Albategni</hi> contends this to be done in ſixty ſix <hi>Aegyptian</hi> yeers: To whom aſſent <hi>Rabbi Levi, Rabbi Zacutus,</hi> and <hi>Alphontius,</hi> in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of his Tables. <hi>Azarcheles</hi> the <hi>Moore</hi> ſaith, they are moved one degree in ſeventy foure yeeres: <hi>Hipparchus</hi> in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty and eight. Many of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as <hi>Rabbi Ioſue, Moyſes, Maymonides, Rabbi Avenezra,</hi> and after them <hi>Hay Benrodam,</hi> in ſeventy yeeres: <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus,</hi> in eighty yeers: <hi>Auguſtinus Ritius</hi> holds the middle betwixt the opinions of <hi>Albategni</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> thinking that the fixed Stars are not moved one part of the Heavens, ſooner then ſixty yeeres; nor ſlower then ſeventy yeers. But <hi>Rabbi Abraham Zacutus</hi> (as <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> tels us) teſtifieth out of the tradition of the <hi>Indians,</hi> that there are yet in Heaven two Stars Diametrally oppoſite one to the other; which, contrary to the order of ſignes, fulfill not their courſe in leſſe then an hundred forty foure yeeres. Alſo <hi>Alpetragus</hi> himſelfe thinks, that there are in the Heavens vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous motions, yet unknown to man; which if it be ſo, there may be Stars and bodies there, to which thoſe motions may agree; which either men cannot diſcerne by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding altitude; or no Arts as yet have by obſervation found out. To which <hi>Phavorinus</hi> the Philoſopher in <hi>Gellius,</hi> aſſents; in his oration againſt the <hi>Genethliacks.</hi> It therefore remaines to conclude, that no Aſtronomer as yet hath deſcended from Heaven, who could teach us the inerrant motion truely and certainly. Neither hath the true motion of <hi>Mars</hi> hitherto been known; which alſo <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> complaines of, in a certain Epiſtle to <hi>Blanchinus.</hi> Alſo one <hi>Gulielmus de ſancto Clodoaldo,</hi> an excellent Aſtrologer, hath left written the errour of the ſame motion, in his obſervations two hundred yeers ſince and more; and none of the latter hath hitherto corrected either him or it. Moreover it is unpoſſible to finde out the true ingreſſe of the <hi>Sunne</hi> into the <hi>aequinoctiall points:</hi> which <hi>Rabbi Levi</hi> proveth by many reaſons. But what ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:46899:122"/>we ſpeake of thoſe that are found out ſince; how the former have erred about them? For many, with <hi>Tebith,</hi> have thought the greateſt declination of the Sunne to be continually varied: when nevertheleſſe it is alwaies carried in one meaſure. Yet <hi>Ptolomy</hi> thought otherwiſe of it; and it wat otherwiſe found out by <hi>Rabbi Levi, Avenezra,</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus.</hi> In like manner, concerning the motion of the Sunne, and meaſure of the yeère, they have found it otherwiſe, then <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parchus</hi> have delivered. Likewiſe, as touching the motion of the <hi>Stage</hi> of the Sunne, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> conceives one thing; but <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bategni,</hi> and the reſt another. Moreover of the images, and conſiderations of the fixed Stars; the <hi>Indians</hi> have delivered their opinions after one manner, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> after another, the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> another, the <hi>Hebrews</hi> another, the <hi>Arabians</hi> another, <hi>Timotheus</hi> another, <hi>Arſatilis</hi> another, <hi>Hipparchus</hi> another, <hi>Ptolemy</hi> another, and the <hi>moderne</hi> writers another. I paſſe by here to tell, how they befoole themſelves about the right and the left principle of the heavens; concerning which St. <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> the <hi>Almaine,</hi> two ſuperſtitious divines, while they ſeriouſly endeavoured to ſay ſomething, could finde nothing to ſay: neither could any man certainly ever finde out any thing. Moreover the <hi>Galaxia,</hi> or the <hi>milkie circle,</hi> what it is, the Aſtrologers are yet ignorant of. I alſo forbeare to lengthen my ſpeech about the <hi>excentricks, concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks, apicycles, retrogradations, trepidations, acceſſes, receſſes, raptures,</hi> and other motions, and circles of motions: ſeeing all theſe are not; are neither the workes of God, nor of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but monſters of the <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and trifles of Feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, derived from corrupt Philoſophy, and the Fables of Poets; to which nevertheleſſe, as it were to true things, and created by God, or eſtabliſhed in nature, theſe Maſters are not aſhamed to give ſo much Faith, as to referre unto theſe trifling vanities, as unto cauſes, whatſoever things are done in theſe inferiours: and ſay, that thoſe feined motions are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of all inferiour motions. Such Aſtronomers as theſe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximenes</hi> his mayd hath opportunely caſtigated, by a ſaying not to be deſpiſed; for ſhe uſing to walke abroad with her maſter <hi>Anaximenes,</hi> who on a certain day going early out of his houſe to inſpect the Starres, while he was ſurely intent in
<pb facs="tcp:46899:122"/>looking up to the heavens, he, unmindſull of the places ſite, fell ſuddenly into a ditch; then ſaid his mayd, I wonder Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon what reaſon you ſhould perſwade your ſelfe that you can foreknow ſuch things as are in Heaven; when as you cannot foreſee thoſe things that are before your own ſeet. The ſame facetious paſſage is reported concerning <hi>Thales Mileſius;</hi> in like manner reproved by his hand mayd <hi>Treſſa.</hi> And it is not unlike to theſe, that <hi>Tully</hi> ſaith; The Aſtrologers while they are ſearching after the coaſtes of Heaven, none of them perceives what is before his own feet. I my ſelfe of a child, have taken in this Art from my parents; and further, I have loſt much time, and labour in it: at length I have learned that this whole art, and every part of it, leaves you no other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but meere toyes and figments of imagination. And it now irketh, and repenteth me of my labour loſt heretofore; and I did deſire to bereave my ſelfe of all memory, and uſe of it, and had long ſince caſt it out of my mind; nor would I ever have reaſſumed it, but that the violent intreaties of ſome potent ones (who are wont ſometimes to abuſe great &amp; good wits, to unworthy artifices) had compelled me to fall upon it again; yea, and my own domeſticall utility did perſwade me, that I ought ſometimes to enjoy their folly, and to obſerve them with trifles, that ſo greatly coveted after trifles. I truly ſay trifles; for what elſe hath Aſtrologie, but meere trifles of Poets and Fables, and portentous figments, with which they faine the heavens to be fully ſtored? Neither doe any kind of men agree more together, then Aſtrologers and Poets doe; excepting that they diſſent about <hi>Lucifer</hi> and <hi>Veſper:</hi> the Poets affirming, that on what day <hi>Lucifer</hi> appeares before the Sunne riſing, on the ſame day it followes the Sunne ſetting; which almoſt all the Aſtrologers deny to be done, beſides thoſe who place <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> above the <hi>Sunne:</hi> becauſe thoſe Starres which are more remote from us, they ſeem in their riſing to riſe ſooner, and in their ſetting to ſet later. But this diſcord of Aſtrologers about the ſite of Stars and Planets, had I not now remembred it, I had paſſed it by: in as much as it belongs not to Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſo much as Philoſophers. For <hi>Plato</hi> after the Moon, places the ſecond Sphere of the Sunne (or the Sphere of the <hi>Sunne</hi> ſecond &amp;c.) the ſame doe the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> placing the <hi>Sunne</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb facs="tcp:46899:123"/>the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> But <hi>Arebimedes,</hi> and the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi> place the <hi>Sunne</hi> the fourth in order. <hi>Anaximander, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodorus, Chius,</hi> and <hi>Crates</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Sunne</hi> is the ſupreame of all, after which the <hi>Moon,</hi> and beneath theſe the reſt errant, and inerrant. <hi>Xenocrates</hi> thinks that all the Stars are moved in one and the ſame ſuperficies: and they diſcord no leſſe about the magnitude and diſtance of the Sunne, the Moon, and the reſt of the Stars. Neither is there any conſtancy of opinion amongſt them about the Celeſtials, nor yet truth; neither is that any marvell, ſeeing the Heaven it ſelfe, which they ſearch, is of all other moſt inconſtant, and moſt repleniſhed with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles and fables; for the very <hi>Twelve ſignes,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Boreall</hi> and <hi>Auſtrall</hi> images, had never aſcended up to heaven, but by Fables. And yet the Aſtrologers live by theſe Fables, and impoſe them upon others, and make a gain thereby. But the Poats in the mean while (the egregious inventors of them) grow poore, and hungry.</p>
               <p>There remaines yet another ſpecies of Aſtrologie, which they call the <hi>Divinatory,</hi> or the <hi>Judiciary;</hi> which treats of the revolutions of the yeers of the world, of <hi>nativities,</hi> of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, of elections, of intentions and cogitations, of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, or powers; for the foretelling, caſting up, eſchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or repelling the events of all things future; even of the ſecret diſpoſitions of divine providence it ſelfe. Hereupon the Aſtrologers doe mart, or vent the effects of the Heavens, and the Stars, from yeers moſt remote, and before all memory of things, or the times of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> or (as they ſay) from the great <hi>conjunctions</hi> before the <hi>Flood.</hi> And they affirm that the effects, forces, motions of all living creatures, ſtones, metals, herbs, and whatſoever things in theſe inferiours, doe flow from theſe ſame Heavens, and Starres, and doe altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, and may be ſearched out by them. Verely theſe are incredulous men, and not leſſe impious, in not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging this one thing, that God had already made the Herbs, Plants, and Trees, even before the Heavens and Stars. Moreover, the moſt grave Philoſophers, as <hi>Pythagoras, Democri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Bion, Favorinus, Panaetius, Carneades, Poſſidonius, Timaeus, Ariſtoteles, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyrius, Avicenna, Averroes, Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Galenus, Alexander Aphrodiſaeus, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:46899:123"/>and many more, who have ſearched the cauſes of things from every Art and Science; yet never remit us to theſe Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall cauſes: which although they were cauſes, yet becauſe they plainly knew not the courſes of the Stars, and their forces (which is a thing moſt known to all wiſe men) they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot give a certain judgement of their effects. Neither are there wanting among them (as <hi>Eudoxus, Archelaus, Caſſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus, Hoychilax, Halicarnaſſaeus</hi>) moſt skilfull <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and many other modern and moſt grave Authors, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it is impoſſible that any thing certain ſhould be found out concerning the ſcience of ſuch judgements: both becauſe of innumerable other cauſes cooperating together with the Heavens, which muſt be attended together; for ſo <hi>Ptolomy</hi> bids: as alſo becauſe very many occaſions doe hinder them; as namely cuſtomes, manners, education, ſhame, command, place, geniture, blood, meat, liberty of mind, and diſcipline; ſeeing theſe influxes compell not (as they ſay) but incline. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, they who have preſcribed the rules of judgements, doe for the moſt part determine ſuch diverſe and repugnant things of the ſame matter; that it is impoſſible for a progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticator to pronounce any thing certaine, from ſo many, and ſo various, and diſſonant opinions; unleſſe there be in him ſome intrinſicall ſenſe of things future, and occult; or ſome inſtinct of preſage, or rather occult and latent inſpiration of the Devill, by which, among theſe he may be able to diſcerne, or may be induced by ſome other way, to adhere now to this, now to that opinion: which inſtinct whoſoever wanteth, he (as <hi>Haly</hi> ſaith) cannot be a Tel-troth in Aſtrologicall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Wherefore now, Aſtrologicall prediction muſt conſiſt not ſo much of Art, as by a kind of obſcure, lot, or chance of things. And as in the books, or games of Lottery, ſometimes ſuch an one is drawn forth, as ſpeaks truth, and hits right; yet not by art, but by chance; ſo it is by chance, and not by art, that vaticinations come forth truely either from the mind, or the mouth of an Aſtrologer. To which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> atteſts ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſcience of the Stars is from thee and from them: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the prediction of things future and occult, is not ſo much from the obſervation of the Stars, as from the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the mind. Therefore is there no certainty of this Art,
<pb facs="tcp:46899:124"/>but it is convertible to all things, according to the opinion which is collected by conjectures, or imagination, or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptible ſuggeſtion of Devils, or ſome ſuperſtitious lot or chance. This art therefore is no other then a fallacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of ſuperſtitious men, who through the uſe of long time, have made a ſcience of uncertain things: in which, for the beguiling men of their money, they may deceive the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and may alſo be deceived themſelves. And if the Art of theſe men be true, and be underſtood by themſelves, whence then bubble out ſo many and ſo great errors in their progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications? But if it be not ſo, doe they not vainly and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and impiouſly, to profeſſe a ſcience of things, that are not, or not underſtood? But the more cautelous of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not upon futures, ſave obſcurely: and ſuch as may be applied to every thing, and time, and Prince, and Nation. Out of a verſatile artifice, doe they feyne ambiguous prognoſticks; and after that any of them ſhall happen, then doe they gather the cauſes thereof; and after the fact or effect, then doe they eſtabliſh old vaticinations with new reaſons; to the intent they may ſeem to have foreſeen. Juſt as the interpreters of dreames, who when they have a dream underſtand nothing of it for certain: but after that ſomething is hapned unto them, then doe they adopt the dream to that which hapned. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, ſeeing it is impoſſible, in ſuch a variety of Stars, but to finde ſome of them well, ſome of them ill poſited; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they take occaſion of ſpeaking what they pleaſe; and to whom they will they predict life, health, honours, riches, power, victory, ſoundneſſe, off-ſpring, marriage, Prieſthood, Magiſtracy, and the like: but if they be ill affected to any, to them they denounce deaths, hangings, reproaches, deſtructions, baniſhments, barrenneſſe, deſolation, calamities, &amp;c. not ſo much out of a wicked art, as out of wicked affections, drawing on to deſtruction thoſe men that are credulous to theſe impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous curioſities: and oft times committing among themſelves both Princes and people, in deadly ſeditions and warres. If that Fortune fall in with their prognoſticks; and among ſo many ambiguous things, if that one or other of them happen to be true, it is a wonder then to behold how they briſtle, being creſt-ſwolne; and how moſt inſolently they predicate their
<pb facs="tcp:46899:124"/>own predictions. But though they lie daily, and be convinced of lying, then they excuſe it by blaſphemy, or cover one lie with another, ſaying, a wiſe man ruleth over the Stars: when as in truth, neither doth a wiſe man overrule the Stars, nor the Stars a wiſe man, but it is God that ruleth over them both; or elſe they ſay, that ſome ineptitude, or incapacity of the receiver hindred the celeſtiall influxes. And they are angry at them who require any further faith, or proofe. Notwithſtanding theſe <hi>circulators</hi> finde Princes and Magiſtrates that believe them in all things, and adorn them with publique ſtipends: when as indeed there is no kind of men more peſtilent to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, then thoſe that ſpread vaticinations, and promiſe things future from the Stars, and inſpected Ghoſts, from dreams, and ſuch like artifices of divination. Beſides they are men alwaies offenſive or abominable to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to all that truly believe in him. Of whom <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſaying, The <hi>Mathematicians</hi> (for ſo they vulgarly named them) are a kind of men trecherous to Princes, and deceitfull to thoſe that give credit to them; they have alwaies been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited our City, and yet we could never have them expelled thence. Yea and <hi>Varro,</hi> a grave Author, teſtifieth, that the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all ſuperſtitions have iſſued from the boſome of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. There was in <hi>Alexandria</hi> a Tribute which the Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers uſed to pay, called <hi>Blacenominon,</hi> for the folly of it; becauſe by an ingenuous folly they got their gain; and becauſe that none but fooles and raſh men uſed to conſult them. For if from the Stars be mens lives and fortunes, why feare we? why are we troubled? Rather let us leave theſe to God, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, who neither can erre nor doe evill. And ſince we are but men, let us not be over wiſe in high matters, and more then is meet, and above our powers; but only ſo far forth as behooveth humane creatures. And moreover, in as much as we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, let us leave to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the houres, and to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> the moments, which he hath put in his own power. But if our life and fortune be not from the Starres, then doth not every Aſtrologer run in vaine? But there is a kind of men ſo time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and credulous, which (like as children doe their Goblin tales) more believe, and are more affraid of thoſe things that
<pb facs="tcp:46899:125"/>are not, then thoſe that are: and by how much a thing is leſſe poſſible, they feare it the more; and by how much it is leſſe like to truth, ſo much the more firmly doe they believe it: who truely, if there were no Aſtrologers and Diviners, would die for hunger. And the fooliſh credulity of theſe men, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of things paſt, and negligent of things preſent, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong upon things future, doth ſo favour theſe deceivers, that whereas in other men the faith of the ſpeaker is rendred or ſuſpected by one lie, that all the reſt of truths are thereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured? on the contrary, as concerning theſe lying Maſters, one fortuitous truth muſt get credit even to notorious lies. To which truely they who truſt moſt, are rendred of all men the moſt unhappy. As theſe ſuperſtitious vanities are wont to bring deſtruction to their obſervers; which antiquity witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in <hi>Zoroaſtes, Pharaoh, Nebuchadonoſor, Caeſar, Craſſus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey, Diotherus, Nero,</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate: who as they were moſt addicted to theſe toyes, ſo they periſhed moſt miſerably in the confidence of them. And to whom the Aſtrologers had promiſed all things fortunate and joyfull; all things fell out moſt dolefull and unfortunate: as to <hi>Pompey, Craſſus,</hi> and <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar;</hi> to none of whom they promiſed other, then that they ſhould die old, at home, and with glory; and yet every one of them periſhed miſerably, and untimely. Verily this is a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious and prepoſterous kind of men, who profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to foreknow things future; and yet are ignorant of things paſt and preſent: and while they profeſſe themſelves to all men, that they can declare all things, although moſt occult, yet very often they know not what is done in their own hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in their own beds.

                  </gap>em unanimouſly agree even about that.

And for as much as it is not evident amongſt them, after what manner they ought to conſtitute the beginnings, and the ends of thoſe <hi>houſes</hi> ſince the Antients fabricate them after one faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Ptolomie</hi> after another, <hi>Campanus</hi> after another, <hi>Johannes Regiomontanus</hi> after another: whence it comes to paſs, that they themſelves by their own obſervations, do diminiſh all faith and credit to themſelves; in that divers of them do aſcribe divers properties to the ſame places; and not only ſo, but beginnings alſo, and ends. An impious kind of men! who attribute thoſe things to the ſtars, the ſtars, that are belonging to God alone: and do make us free-born, to be the ſtars born ſlaves. And whereas we know that God created all things good; they deliver that there are certain ſtars malevolous, and authors of wickedneſſes, and of evil influxes: not without the greateſt injury of God, and the heavens, that may be, defining that in thoſe coeleſtials, and in that divine Senate, evils, and wickedneſſes are decreed to be
<pb facs="tcp:46899:126"/>done. And impute wholly to the ſtars, whatſoever is committed by us, through the fault of our own will; and what may fall out againſt order in nature, through the fault of the matter. Yea they fear not to teach moſt pernicious hereſies, and infidelities; namely, while they propheſſe with impious temerity, that the gift of Prophecy, the power of Religion, the ſecrets of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the command over devils, the vertue of miracles, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of ſupplications, and the ſtate of the life to come, do all depend upon the ſtars, are vouchſafed by them, and may be known from them. For they ſay, that the ſtar of the <hi>Twins</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, with <hi>Saturn,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> joyned under <hi>Aquarius,</hi> in the ninth coaſt of heaven, a Prophet muſt be born: and that therfore the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> was excellent in ſo many mighty works becauſe in the ſame place, he had <hi>Saturn</hi> in <hi>Gemini.</hi> Alſo the ſects of Religion, over which they place <hi>Jupiter</hi> as chief patron, they diſtribute by commixtion of other ſtars: ſo as <hi>Jupiter</hi> with <hi>Saturn,</hi> ſhould make the Religion of the <hi>Jews;</hi> with <hi>Mars</hi> of the <hi>Chaldeans;</hi> with <hi>Sol</hi> of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> with <hi>Venus</hi> of the <hi>Saracens;</hi> with <hi>Mercury</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> with <hi>Luna,</hi> that of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> which they ſay is yet to come. And that <hi>Moſes,</hi> from Aſtrological rules and reaſons, inſtituted the <hi>Sabbath</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to be obſerved as a Religious day: and that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> therefore do erre in not reſting from labour, and keeping holy day on the <hi>Jewiſh Sabbath,</hi> ſeeing it is <hi>Saturns</hi> day. Alſo they think that the fidelity of every one, towards men, or towards God, and profeſt Religion, and ſecrets of Conſcience, may be deprehended from part of the Sun, and from the third, ninth, and eleventh houſes of heaven: and they delivering many rules of foreknowing the thoughts, and as they ſay, the intentions of men. And they ſet up the coeleſtial configurations as the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the very miraculous works of divine omnipotence; as namely, of the <hi>univerſal flood,</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the <hi>virgins</hi> child-birth: and they fable, that the death of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Redeemer of man-kind, was the work of <hi>Mars:</hi> and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, in his miracles, uſed the election of hours, in which the <hi>Jews</hi> could not hurt him, while he went up to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> and therefore he ſaid to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> diſwading him, <hi>are there not twelve hours of the day?</hi> They ſay moreover, that whoſoever hath <hi>Mars</hi> happily placed in a new houſe of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
<pb facs="tcp:46899:126"/>he ſhall, by his ſole preſence, expel devils out of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. And he that ſhall make ſupplication to God, the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> with the <hi>Dragons head,</hi> being conjoyned in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle heaven; ſhall obtain all things, whatſoever he ſhall ask. And further, that the felicity of the life to come is beſtowed by <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn.</hi> And that if any man in his geniture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath <hi>Saturn</hi> happily conſtituted in <hi>Leo;</hi> his ſoul, after this life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from innumerable miſeries, ſhall paſſe to heaven, the firſt beginning of its original, and be applyed to the Gods. But for all this, to theſe execrable fopperies, and pernicious hereſies <hi>Petrus Apponenſis, Roger Bacon, Guido Bonatus, Arnoldus de nova villa,</hi> Philoſophers; and <hi>Alyanenſis,</hi> a <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and a Theologue, and divers other <hi>Doctors</hi> of a Chriſtian name (not without an infamy of hereſie) do ſubſcribe: yea and dare teſtifie, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that they have experienced theſe for truth. But <hi>Johannes Picus Mirandula</hi> of late yeers, hath written againſt <hi>Aſtrologers,</hi> in twelve Books; and that in ſo great copiouſneſſe, that ſcarce any argument hath eſcaped him: as alſo with ſo great efficacy; ſo that hitherto, neither <hi>Lucius Balnutius,</hi> an eager propugna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Aſtrologie, nor yet any other defender of this Art, could ſave it from thoſe reaſons, that <hi>Picus</hi> hath brought againſt it. For he proveth, by moſt ſtrong arguments, it to have been the invention not of men, but of Devils. Which ſelf-ſame thing <hi>Firmianus</hi> ſaith; by which they have endeavoured to aboliſh all Philoſophie, Medicine, Laws, and Religion, to the utter exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of man-kind. For firſt, it detracts from the faith of Religion, it extenuates miracles, it takes away providence: while it teaches that all things come to paſſe by the force of conſtellations, and that they doe depend by a fatal neceſſity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtars. Moreover it patronizes vices, excuſing them as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from heaven upon us. It defiles and overthrows all good Arts; eſpecially Philoſophie; traducing cauſes from true reaſons, to fables; and Medicine in like manner, turning from natural, and effectual remedies, to vain obſervations, and perverſe ſuperſtitions, deſtructive both to body and minde. Further, it utterly undoes Laws, manners, and whatſoever Arts of humane prudence: while it would have Aſtrologie onely conſulted, at what time, after what maner, and by what means any thing is to be done; as if it alone, drawing its authority over all down from heaven; did hold the ſcepter over life,
<pb facs="tcp:46899:127"/>manners, and all both publike and private matters; and as if all other things were to be reputed vain, that did not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it for patron. Indeed an Art moſt worthy for devils to profeſſe from the firſt, to the deceit of man, and diſhonour of God. Moreover the hereſie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> wholly taking away all liberty of will, flowed not elſwhere, then from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers falſe opinion, and doctrine of Fate. From the ſame fountain alſo ſprung the hereſie of <hi>Baſilides,</hi> who pronounced 365. heavens, made of one another by ſucceſſion and ſimilitude, and the oftenſion of theſe to be the number of the dayes of the yeer (or the number of the days of the yeer to be the oftenſion of theſe) aſſigning to every one of them certain principles, and vertues, and Angels, and feigning names for them: but the chief of them all is <hi>Abraxas;</hi> which name, according to the Greek letters, containeth in it 365. which namely are the local poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe heavens commentitiouſly diviſed by it. Theſe things are therefore ſhown, that ye may know, that Aſtrology is the begetter of hereticks. Furthermore, as all the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Philoſophers do explode this divinatory Aſtrologie: ſo <hi>Moſes, Eſaias, Job, Jeremias,</hi> and all the other Prophets of the old Law, do deteſt it. And of the Catholike Doctors, <hi>Auguſtin</hi> cenſures it as meet to be expelled Chriſtian Religion; <hi>Hierome</hi> diſputes it to be a kinde of Idolatry; <hi>Baſil,</hi> and <hi>Cyprian</hi> do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride it; <hi>Chryſoſtome, Euſebius,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius,</hi> do refute it; <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, Ambroſe,</hi> and <hi>Severianus</hi> inveigh againſt it; the holy <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Councel</hi> forbids, and damns it; alſo it was anathematized in the Synod of <hi>Martin,</hi> and by <hi>Gregory</hi> the younger, and by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the third, Popes; and was puniſhed by the civil Laws of the Emperours. Among the antient <hi>Romans</hi> under <hi>Tiberius, Vitellius, Diocleſian, Conſtantine, Gratian, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> the Emperours, it was prohibited the City ejected, and puniſhed; and by <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf condemned capitally, as is manifeſt in his <hi>Code.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This place admoniſhes me to ſpeak of the other Arts of divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which yield vaticinations not ſo much by obſervation of the coeleſtials, as of inferiour things, having a certain ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or imitation of the coeleſtials: that they being underſtood ye may the better know this <hi>Aſtrological Tree,</hi> from which do fall ſuch fruit: and from which, as a <hi>Lernaean Hydra,</hi> a beaſt of many heads is generated. Amongſt the arts therefore that are
<pb facs="tcp:46899:127"/>haſty to divine for their own gain, <hi>Phyſiognomy, Metopoſcopy, Chiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy, Aruſpicy,</hi> the <hi>Speculatory,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Onirocritical,</hi> which is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of dreams, and the <hi>Oracles</hi> of the <hi>furious,</hi> here challenge their ſeat. Now all theſe artifices are of no ſolid doctrine, neither do conſiſt of any certain reaſons but inquire of occult things, either by fortuitous lot, or agnition of ſpirit, or certain appearing conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, which are taken up from quotidian obſervations of long time. For all theſe prodigious arts of divination are wont to defend themſelves no other way, but by the title of experience, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate themſelves out of the bonds of objections; ſo often as they teach or promiſe any thing above faith, and beſide reaſon. Of all which it is thus commanded in the Law; <hi>There ſhall not be found among you any one that maketh his ſon, or his daughter to paſſe through the fire, or that uſeth divination, or an obſerver of times, or an inchanter, or a witch, or a charmer, or a conſulter with familiar ſpirits, or a wizzard, or a Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancer. For all that do theſe things are an abomination unto the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> following from the inſpection of the whole body, preſumeth it can by probable ſigns attain to know, what are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of body, and mind, and what a mans fortune ſhall be: ſo far forth as it pronounceth him <hi>Saturnial,</hi> or <hi>Jovial;</hi> and him <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> or <hi>Solar;</hi> another <hi>Venereal, Mercurial,</hi> or <hi>Lunar:</hi> and collecting their <hi>horoſcopes</hi> from the habitude of the body; and from affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tranſcending, as they ſay, by little and little, unto cauſes namely Aſtrological; out of which they afterward trifle as they liſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Metopoſcopy,</hi> out of a ſagacious ingenie, and learned experience, boaſts her ſelf to foreſent all the beginnings, the progreſſes, and the ends of men; out of the ſole inſpection of the <hi>forehead:</hi> making her ſelf alſo to be the pupil of Aſtrologie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chiromancie</hi> feigns <hi>ſeven mounts</hi> in the <hi>palm</hi> of the <hi>hand,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the ſeven <hi>Planets;</hi> and ſuppoſes it can know from the <hi>lines</hi> there to be ſeen, what a mans complexion is, what his affections, and what his fortune, &amp;c.—But we need no other reaſon to impugn the error of all theſe Arts, then this ſelf-ſame, namely, that they are void of all reaſon. Yet very many of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients have written of theſe, &amp;c.—But they all can deliver no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond conjectures, and obſervations of experience. Yet, that there is not any rule of truth to theſe conjectures, and obſervations is manifeſt from this; becauſe they are voluntary figments; and upon which their teachers, even of equal learning and authority, are not agreed.—But this trifling kind of men is wont ſo to
<pb facs="tcp:46899:128"/>doat through the inſtinct of devils, drawing them from error in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuperſtition, and from this by degrees into infidelity.</p>
               <p>To the art of <hi>Augury</hi> they make faith, who teach that certain lights of preſagition do deſcend from the coeleſtials, upon all thoſe inferior living creatures: as certain ſignes conſtituted in their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſite, geſture, going, flight, voice, meat, colour, work, event: by which, as by a certain ingraffed hidden force, and firm conſent, they ſo agree with the coeleſtial bodies, with whoſe powers they are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; that they can preſage all things whatſoever that the coeleſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bodies intend to do, whereupon it is manifeſt, that this divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on followes not, but from conjectures, partly taken from the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the ſtars, as they ſay: and partly from certain parabolical fimilitudes: then which nothing can be more fallacious. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Panaetius, Carneades, Cicero, Chryſippus, Diogenes, Antipater, Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> have derided it; the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it.</p>
               <p>They who endeavour to perſwade that nothing is dream't in vain ſay; that like as the coeleſtial influxes do produce divers forms in corporal matter: ſo from the ſame influxes in the phantaſtical fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, which is organical, there are phantaſms impreſſed by the coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial diſpoſition, conſentaneous to the producing any kind of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; eſpecially in Dreams; becauſe the mind is then more freed from the body, and external cares, and ſo receives thoſe divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes more freely: whence it comes to paſſe that many things are made known in dreams to men ſleeping, which are concealed from them waking. By this reaſon chiefly they labour to reconcile an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of truth to dreams: and yet of the cauſes of dreams, both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical, and extrinſical, they do not all of them agree in one opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, &amp;c.—Of dreams nothing is delivered but meer dreams, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To theſe dreamers, we may number thoſe, who give a faith of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to the vaticinations of madmen: and think they have attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a divine preſcience of things to come, who have loſt all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things preſent, all memory of things paſt, together with all humane ſenſe: and that mad men, and ſleepers ſee thoſe things, which wiſe men and waking are ignorant of: as if God were neerer to them then to the ſound, watchful, intelligent, and premeditating. In truth, they are unhappy men, who believe theſe vanities, and obey theſe impoſtures; who cheriſh theſe kind of artificers, and ſubmit their wits, and faith, to theſe their vain deluſions.</p>
               <p>All theſe artifices of divination have their rooting, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:46899:128"/>in <hi>Aſtrologie.</hi> For whether the body, the face, or the hand be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected; whether a <hi>dream,</hi> or a <hi>prodigie</hi> be ſeen; whether an <hi>auſpicie,</hi> or a <hi>Fury</hi> be inſpired; they conſult to erect a figure of Heaven; out of whoſe tokens, together with conjectures of ſimilitudes &amp; ſigns, they hunt for opinions of things ſignified, and ſo all Divinations chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themſelves the Art, and uſe of <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> and confeſſe this to be as it were the key to the neceſſary knowledge of all ſecret things. Wherefore, all thoſe arts of divination, how far they are from truth they plainly diſcover themſelves in this; in that they uſe principles ſo manifeſtly falſe, and feigned by a poeticall temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: which neither are, nor have been, nor ever ſhall be; yet are they made the cauſes, and ſignes to which all events of things are to be referred, contrary to all evident truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Magick</hi> is ſo neer joyned to, and of affinity with <hi>Aſtrologie;</hi> ſo that he who profeſſeth Magick without Aſtrologie, doth nothing, but erreth altogether.</p>
               <p>There is an Art given to mortal men, whereby they might gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate certain latter things, not partaking of truth, and divinity, but might deduce certain images like unto themſelves: and Magicians, moſt audacious men, have gone ſo farre to perpetrate all things, that old and ſtrong <hi>Serpent,</hi> the promiſer of Sciences, eſpecially favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that they, like to him, Apes, have endeavoured to emulate both God and nature.</p>
               <p>To ſuch a height of madneſſe ſome of the Magicians are grown, that from diverſe conſtellations of the Stars, through internals of times, and by a certain reaſon of proportions, being rightly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, they think that a fabricated image of the heavenly creatures may with a becke receive the ſpirit of life and underſtanding, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may anſwer thoſe that conſult it, and reveale the ſecrets of hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den truth. Hence it is plain; that this <hi>naturall Magick</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times enclined towards <hi>Goetie</hi> and <hi>Theurgie,</hi> is inſnared very often in the wiles and errours of evill ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Of ceremoniall Magick there are two parts, <hi>Goetie</hi> and <hi>Theurgie. Goetie</hi> unfortunately began by the commerce with unclean ſpirits, compacted of the rites of wicked curioſity, unlawfull charms, and deprecations, is exerated, &amp; baniſhed by the verdicts of all Lawes.—Theſe are they who carry about them familiar ſpirits—doe feigne themſelves to prophecy.—Some of them ſtudy to call and compell evill ſpirits adjured by ſome certain powers, eſpecially of divine names, &amp;c.—Others moſt wicked, and by miſchiefe deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be puniſhed with all fires, ſubmit themſelves to devils,
<pb facs="tcp:46899:129"/>ſacrifice to them, and adore them, and are become guilty of idolatry, and the vileſt abaſements; to which crimes if the former be not obnoxious, yet they expoſe themſelves to manifeſt dangers. For even compelled divels doe watch, to the intent they may alwaies deceive us in our errours. From this Sect (or rather ſinke) of the <hi>Goeticks</hi> have iſſued all theſe books of darkneſſe, &amp;c.—excogitated by men of deplored wits.—Which books to him that more acutely looks into them, and into the canon of their precepts, the cuſtome of rites, the kind of words, and characters, the order of extruction, and the inſulſate phraſe, doe openly bewray themſelves, to containe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but mere toyes, and impoſtures; and to be pulcht up in latin Hims by the forlorne artificers of perdition, ignorant of all ancient Magick, out of certain profane obſervations, mixt with the ceremonies of our religion, many unknown names and ſeales inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that they might terrifie the rude and ſimple, and be an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſenceleſſe, and ſuch as know not good Letters.—But this is the reaſon why theſe <hi>Goeticks</hi> onely make uſe of evill ſpirits; becauſe good Angels will hardly appeare; for they expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and aſſemble not but with men of clean heart, and holy life; but the evill ones eaſily exhibite themſelves to be invoked, falſly favouring, and belying a divinity, are alwaies at hand, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by their ſubtilty, to the intent they may be worſhipped and adored.</p>
               <p>Many think that <hi>Theurgie</hi> is not unlawfull, as if this were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by good Angels, and a divine power: when as very often under the names of God, and Angels, it is obſtringed with the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of evill ſpirits.—Of this ſchoole are the art <hi>Almadel,</hi> the art <hi>Noterie,</hi> the <hi>Pauline</hi> art, the art of <hi>Revelations,</hi> and many more of the ſame ſuperſtition; which are ſo much the more pernicious, as to the unskilfull they ſeem the more divine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Cabalie</hi> is an art (as is reported) very ancient, and yet the name hath not been known among Chriſtians but of later times. — This art of <hi>Cabalie,</hi> which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſo boaſt of, I ſometimes have ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with much labour; and I finde and confeſſe it to be nothing elſe but a meer <hi>rapſodie</hi> of ſuperſtition, &amp; a certain <hi>theurgicall</hi> magick, but if proceeding from God (as the <hi>Jews</hi> boaſt) it any whit conduced to the perfection of life, to the ſalvation of men, to the worſhip of God, &amp; to the underſtanding of the truth; verily that <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> which (the <hi>Synagogue</hi> rejected) came unto us to teach us all truth, would not have concealed it from his Church until theſe laſt times,
<pb facs="tcp:46899:129"/>which truly knoweth all things that are of God.—But that we try, and ſee, that by the revolutions (as they call them) of this art, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful ſentences of great myſteries are wreſted out of ſacred Letters; the whole is nothing elſe; but a certain playing upon Allegories; which idle men, buſied in every letter, point and number (which this tongue, and the manner of writing eaſily ſuffer) do feign &amp; refeigne at their pleaſure.—Therefore this <hi>Cabalie</hi> of the <hi>Iewes</hi> is nothing elſe but a certaine pernicious ſuperſtition, which collecteth, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, transferreth words, and names, and letters ſcatteringly placed in the Scripture; and as they liſt making one thing of another, they diſſolve the parts of truth, the ſpeeches, the inductions, and making parables here and there of their own fictions, they would adopt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the words of God, defaming the Scriptures, ſaying, that their figments do conſiſt of them, they calumniate the Law of God by their impudently extorted ſupputations of dictions, ſyllables, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, numbers; they attempt to inferre violent and blaſphemous proofe of their perfidiouſneſſe. Furthermore, being puft up with theſe trifles, they boaſt themſelves to finde out, and to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable myſteries of God, and ſecrets that are above the Scriptures; by which they are not aſhamed to lie with great boldneſſe, and without bluſhing, that they themſelves can prophecy and work mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles and mighty works.</p>
               <p>But let us return unto Magick, parcell whereof is the artifice of preſtigious things, that is, of illuſions; which are only done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to appearance, by which Magicians ſhew phantaſms, play many miracles by circulatory frauds, and cauſe dreams: which is done not ſo much by <hi>Goeticall</hi> incantations, imprecations, and deceits of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; as alſo by certain vapors of perfumes, lights, <hi>phyltres, collyries,</hi> alligations, and ſuſpenſions; and beſides by rings, images, glaſſes, and ſuch like drugs and inſtruments of magicall art, and by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and celeſtiall vertue. Alſo many things are done by a prompt ſubtlety and induſtry of hand; of which ſort we ſee ſome are done daily by Stageplayers and juglers, which therefore we call <hi>Chiroſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts,</hi> that is, ſlight-handed.—And now, by what hath been ſaid, it is plaine, that Magick is nothing elſe but a collection, or compact of idolatry, <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and ſuperſtitious Medicine. And now alſo there is, by <hi>Magicians,</hi> a great company of <hi>Hereticks</hi> riſen up in the Church, who as <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> reſiſted <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo have they reſiſted the <hi>Apoſtolicall</hi> truth.</p>
               <p>All this is uttered againſt them by our <hi>Arch magician,</hi> I mean <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Agrippa:</hi> not a little to the like affect might be collect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d out
<pb facs="tcp:46899:130" rendition="simple:additions"/>of another of them, namely <hi>Johannes Trithemius;</hi> yea undoubtedly, he that had but the opportunity to peruſe their Authors (old, and of late) needs for their confutation, to urge them with no more, then their own confeſſion. Onely I would aske of them this one thing, what doe they think of this one Magician, for this one act of his? Whether doe they conceive him (in charity) to have thus confeſſed, retracted, recanted, repented returned? &amp;c. or, doe they uncharitably account him for it, to be humorous, cynicall, ſatyricall, invective, diſtracted, mad, malecontent, &amp;c? And whether for this one under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of his will they have him called a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> a <hi>Daemon,</hi> an <hi>Heroe,</hi> a <hi>God, all things,</hi> or nothing? Does not he himſelfe tell us, what kind of cenſure he ſuſpects from all kinds of <hi>Mag-aſtro-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers?</hi> Alas (quoth he) with how many of their machinations will they oppugne me? with how many devices will they aſſaile me? with what ignominies will they perſecute me? — The impious <hi>Mathematician</hi> will preſcribe me both earth and heaven. — The ſortilegious <hi>Pythagoriſt</hi> will ſuppute for me unlucky numbers. The pointing <hi>Geomantick</hi> will caſt unhappy figures, and project for me a priſon, and ſorrow.—The <hi>Fatall Aſtrologers</hi> will threaten any hanging, and by a ſlippery turning of the heavens, inhibit my aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to the Gods above. The menacing <hi>Diviner</hi> will ominate all manner of evill to me. The importunate <hi>Phyſiognomiſt</hi> will defame me for frigide, and inſufficient. The doting <hi>Metopoſcopiſt</hi> will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce me for a brainſick Aſſe. The fatidicall <hi>Chiromantiſt</hi> will divine all things ſiniſterly of me. The preſaging <hi>Aruſpex</hi> will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurate me with all manner of ill luck. The portentous <hi>Speculator</hi> wil ſend revengefull flames of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and fires of preſaging thunder. The dusky <hi>Oniropoliſt,</hi> or Dream-teller will affright me with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnall <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Goblins.</hi> The <hi>furious Vaticinator</hi> wil deceive me with an ambiguous Oracle. The prodigious <hi>Magicians</hi> wil tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me (as another <hi>Apuleius</hi> or <hi>Lucian</hi>) not into a golden, but peradventure into a dirty Aſſe. The black <hi>Goeticke</hi> wil perſecute me with <hi>Spectres</hi> and <hi>Spirits.</hi> The ſacrilegious <hi>Theurgiſt</hi> wil conſecrate my head to the Crows, or perhaps to the Jakes. The circumciſed <hi>Cabaliſts</hi> wil imprecate their curſe upon me. The old doting <hi>praeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator</hi> will repreſent me as an headleſſe Eunuch, &amp;c. To conclude therefore in a word, ſince this is the ſuſpition of one of their own, what then muſt another expect from them? But (God be bleſſed) we are taugh to diſcover their madneſſe, and deſpiſe their malice, by a better light, and ſtrength, then all their own confeſſions can afford us.</p>
